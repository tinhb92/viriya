       "'Contents\\nNotes on Eating  \\n7Contemplations for Eating  \\n95NOTES ON EATING\\nA8B Mindful Eating\\nTo cultivate mindfulness, we can do the same \\nthings we always doŠwalking, sitting, working, \\neating, and so onŠwith mindful awareness \\nof what we are doing. When we™re eating, we \\nknow that we are eating. When we open a \\ndoor, we know that we™re opening a door. Our \\nmind is with our actions. \\nWhen you put a piece of fruit into your \\nmouth, all you need is a little bit of mindfulness \\nto be aware:  ﬁI am putting a piece of apple \\nin my mouth.ﬂ Your mind doesn™t need to be \\nsomewhere else. If you™re thinking of work while \\nyou chew, that™s not eating mindfully. When you \\npay attention to the apple, that is mindfulness. \\nThen you can look more deeply and in just a \\nvery short time you will see the apple seed, the \\nA9B beautiful orchard and the sky, the farmer, the \\npicker, and so on. A lot of work is in that apple! \\nA10B Nothing Comes \\n from Nothing\\nWith just a little bit of mindfulness, you can \\ntruly see where your bread comes from. It has \\nnot come from nothing. Bread comes from \\nthe wheat ˜elds, from hard work, and from the \\nbaker, the supplier, and the seller. But the bread \\nis more than that. The wheat ˜eld needs clouds \\nand sunshine. So in this slice of bread there is \\nsunshine, there is cloud, there is the labor of the \\nfarmer, the joy of having ˚our, and the skill of \\nthe baker and thenŠmiraculously!Šthere is the \\nbread. The whole cosmos has come together \\nso that this piece of bread can be in your hand. \\nYou don™t need to do a lot of hard work to get \\nthis insight. You only need to stop letting your \\nmind carry you away with worrying, thinking, \\nand planning. \\nA11B Your Body Belongs \\n to the Earth \\nIn modern life, people tend to think their \\nbodies belong to them, that they can do any\\n-thing they want to themselves. But your body \\nis not only yours. Your body belongs to your \\nancestors, your parents, and future genera\\n-tions. It also belongs to society and to all the \\nother living beings. The trees, the clouds, the \\nsoil, and every living thing brought about the \\npresence of your body. We can eat with care, \\nknowing we are caretakers of our bodies, \\nrather than their owners.\\nA12B Eating without Thinking\\nWhen we eat we usually think. We can enjoy \\nour eating a lot more if we practice not think\\n-ing when we eat. We can just be aware of the \\nfood. Sometimes we eat and we™re not aware \\nthat we™re eating. Our mind isn™t there. When \\nour mind isn™t present, we look but we don™t \\nsee, we listen but we don™t hear, we eat but \\nwe don™t know the ˚avor of the food. This is a \\nstate of forgetfulness, the lack of mindfulness. \\nTo be truly present we have to stop our think\\n-ing. This is the secret of success.\\nA13B Waiting without Waiting\\nWhen we serve ourselves food and then bring \\nit to the table, we don™t need to feel we™re wait\\n-ing for other people to serve themselves and \\nbe seated. All we have to do is breathe and \\nenjoy sitting. We haven™t eaten our meal yet, \\nbut we can already feel joy and gratitude. It™s \\nan opportunity for us to be peaceful. \\nStanding in line at a grocery store or a \\nrestaurant, or waiting for the time to eat, we \\ndon™t need to waste our time. We don™t need \\nto ﬁwaitﬂ for one second. Instead, we can enjoy \\nbreathing in and out for our nourishment and \\nhealing. We can use that time to notice that we \\nwill soon be able to have food, and we can be \\nhappy and grateful during that time. Instead of \\nwaiting, we can generate joy.\\nA14B Slowing Down\\nWhen we can slow down and really enjoy our \\nfood, our life takes on a much deeper quality. \\nI love to sit and eat quietly and enjoy each \\nbite, aware of the presence of my community, \\naware of all the hard and loving work that has \\ngone into my food. When I eat in this way, \\nnot only am I physically nourished, I am also \\nspiritually nourished. The way I eat in˚uences \\neverything else that I do during the day.\\nEating is as important a time for medita\\n-tion as sitting or walking mediation time. It™s a \\nchance to receive the many gifts of the Earth \\nthat I would not otherwise bene˜t from if my \\nmind were elsewhere. Here is a verse I like to \\nrecite when I eat:\\nA15B In the dimension of space and time,\\nWe chew as rhythmically as we breathe.\\nMaintaining the lives of all our ancestors,\\nOpening an upward path for descendants.\\nWe can use the time of eating to nourish the \\nbest things our relatives have passed onto \\nus and to transmit what is most precious to \\nfuture generations.\\nA16B Paying Attention \\n to Just Two Things \\nWhile we eat, we can try to pay attention to \\njust two things: the food that we™re eating \\nand our friends who are sitting around us and \\neating with us. This is called mindfulness of \\nfood and mindfulness of community. Eating \\nmindfully, we become aware of all the work \\nand energy that has gone into bringing the \\nfood to us. If we are eating with others, we \\ncan notice how wonderful it is that during \\nthis sometimes hectic life we can ˜nd the \\ntime to sit together in a relaxed way like \\nthis to enjoy a meal. When you can breathe, \\nsit, and eat together with your family or \\nfriends in mindfulness, this is called true \\ncommunity-building.\\nA17B Each Spoonful Contains \\nthe Universe\\nPay attention to each spoonful of food. As you \\nbring it up to your mouth, use your mindfulness \\nto be aware that this food is the gift of the \\nwhole universe. The Earth and the sky have \\ncollaborated to bring this spoonful of food to \\nyou. While breathing in and out, you only need \\na second or two to recognize this. We eat in \\nsuch a way that every morsel of food, every \\nmoment of eating has mindfulness in it. It takes \\nonly a few seconds to see that the food we™re \\nholding in our spoon is the gift of the whole \\ncosmos. While we chew, we maintain that \\nawareness. When we chew, we know that the \\nwhole universe is there in that bite of food.\\nBreathing Comes First\\nThe ˜rst thing to do when you sit down with \\nyour bowl of food is to stop the thinking and \\nbe aware of your breathing. Breathe in such a \\nway that you are nourished. You are nourished \\nby your breathing and you nourish other \\npeople with your practice of breathing. We \\nnourish one another. \\nA19B Turning off the TV\\nSometimes people eat while watching \\n˛˝. \\nBut \\neven if you turn o˙ the \\n˛˝\\n, the \\n˛˝\\n in your mind \\ncontinues to run. So you have to also stop the \\n˛˝\\n in your head. If there is thinking still going \\non in your mind, you™ll be dispersed. To be \\ntruly present you need to not just turn o˙ the \\ntelevision or radio in your house, you need \\nto turn o˙ the conversation and images in \\nyour head.\\nA20B How Much Is Enough\\nWe don™t need to eat a lot to feel nourished. \\nWhen we are fully there and alive for every \\nmorsel of food, we eat in a way that each bite \\n˜lls us with peace and happiness. If we are full \\nof this joy, we may ˜nd that we naturally feel \\nsatis˜ed with less food. \\nA21B Preparing a Meal\\nWhen you prepare a meal with artful aware\\n-ness, it™s delicious and healthy. You have put \\nyour mindfulness, love, and care into the meal, \\nthen people will be eating your love. People \\ncan fully enjoy the meal with body and mind, \\njust like you enjoy a beautiful work of art. \\nEating is not only nourishing for the body, but \\nalso for the mind.\\nA23\\nB The Kitchen\\nThe kitchen can be a meditative practice \\nspace if we practice mindful awareness while \\nwe are cooking and cleaning there. We can set \\nan intention to execute our tasks in a relaxed \\nand serene way, following our breathing and \\nkeeping our concentration on what we are \\ndoing. If we are working with others, we may \\nonly need to exchange a few words about the \\nwork at hand.\\nA24B A Kitchen Altar\\nIn your own kitchen, you might want to create \\na kitchen altar to remind yourself to practice \\nmindfulness while cooking. It can be just a \\nsmall shelf with enough room for an incense \\nholder and perhaps a small ˚ower vase, a \\nbeautiful stone, a small picture of an ancestor \\nor spiritual teacher, or a statueŠwhatever is \\nmost meaningful to you. When you come into \\nthe kitchen, you can begin your work by o˙er\\n-ing incense and practicing mindful breathing, \\nmaking the kitchen into a meditation hall.\\nCooking without Rushing\\nWhile cooking, allow enough time so you don™t \\nfeel rushed. If we are aware that our bodies \\nand those of our loved ones depend on the \\nfood we™re preparing, this awareness will guide \\nus to cook healthy food infused with our love \\nand mindful attention.\\nA26B Practicing Peace while \\nChopping Vegetables\\nPeace can be practiced while chopping \\nvegetables, cooking, washing dishes, watering \\nthe vegetable garden, and also while driving \\nor working. Practice releasing the tension in \\nbody and mind and being completely with your \\ntask. The time when you work in the kitchen is \\nalso the time for meditation.\\nA27B Setting the Table\\nEating a meal in mindfulness is an important \\npractice. We turn o˙ the \\n˛˝\\n, put down our \\nnewspaper, and work together for ˜ve or \\nten minutes, setting the table and ˜nishing \\nwhatever needs to be done. During these few \\nminutes, we can be very happy. When the \\nfood is on the table and eveyone is seated, \\nwe practice breathing. ﬁBreathing in, I calm my \\nbody. Breathing out, I smile,ﬂ we repeat three \\ntimes. We can recover ourselves completely \\nafter three breaths like this. \\nA28B Cooking with Joy\\nCooking can bring us a lot of joy. When I \\nput the water into the basin for washing the \\nvegetables, I look deeply at the water to \\nsee its wonderful nature. I see that the water \\ncomes from high in the mountains or from \\ndeep within the Earth right into our kitchen. \\nI know that there are places where people \\nhave to walk several miles just to carry back \\na pail of water on their shoulders. Here, water \\nis available whenever I turn on the tap. Aware \\nof the preciousness of clean water, I value the \\nwater that is available to me. I also value the \\nelectricity that I use to turn on a light or to boil \\nwater. I only need to be aware that there is \\nwater and electricity easily accessible to me, \\nand I can be happy straightaway. When I am \\npeeling vegetables or cooking them, I can do \\nA29B it in mindfulness and with love. I see cooking \\nas a way to o˙er nourishment and care to my \\nfamily and friends. I will easily ˜nd joy and \\npeace in the work. Looking deeply at a tomato, \\na bunch of grapes, or a piece of tofu, I can see \\nthe wonderful nature of these things, how they \\nwere nurtured by the soil, the sun, the rain, \\nand the seed. Try to organize your life so that \\nyou have enough time and energy to cook in a \\nleisurely and peaceful way. The energy of love \\nand harmony in the kitchen will penetrate into \\nthe food that you™re cooking to o˙er to your \\nloved ones and yourself. \\nA30\\nB A grain of rice Contains \\nthe universe\\nWhen we look at a grain of rice, one second \\nof mindfulness and concentration allows us to \\nsee that this grain contains the whole worldŠ\\nthe rain, the cloud, the Earth, time, space, \\nfarmers, everything. Mindfulness and con\\n-centration bring insight, and suddenly we can \\nsee so much in a grain of rice. It™s very quick! \\nWherever there is mindfulness and concentra\\n-tion, there is insight. When you put that grain \\nof rice into your mouth, you are putting the \\nwhole universe in your mouth. This is possible \\nwhen you stop your thinking. When you chew \\nthat grain of rice, just chew, so no thinking will \\ncut you o˙ from this wonderful reality.\\nA31B Communion\\nIn some traditions, monastics want to take their \\nminds o˙ food and focus on the virtues of a \\nspiritual life. In my tradition, we do the oppo\\n-site. We just focus on the food. We see the \\nfood as the cosmos. In the Catholic tradition, \\nin the Eucharist you see the piece of bread as \\nthe body of Jesus. In the Buddhist tradition, \\nwe see the piece of bread as the body of the \\ncosmos. Everything is there. When you chew \\nit mindfully, without thinking, you can see very \\nwell all that the piece of bread contains. That \\nis why when you take a bite of the bread and \\nchew mindfully, you are truly in communion \\nwith all of life.\\nA32B Take Your Time\\nIt™s good to take time to eat, because the time \\nfor a meal can be a very happy time. Take time \\nto enjoy your breakfast, lunch, and dinner. \\nEnjoy your meal. Stop the thinking and be \\nthere fully, body and mind.\\nA34B an Ambassador \\n of the cosmos\\nWhen you pick up an ear of corn, take one \\nsecond to look at it. You can see the Earth, the \\nsunshine, and the rain in the corn. Everything \\nhas come together to produce that corn you \\nare holding. So the corn is an ambassador \\ncoming to nourish you. It only takes one or two \\nseconds to get that insight. When you put the \\ncorn into your mouth, chew it mindfully and \\ngreet the universe. \\nA35B Chew Your Food, \\n Not Your Worries\\nSometimes we eat, but we aren™t thinking of \\nour food. We™re thinking of the past or the \\nfuture or mulling over some worry or\\n anxiety \\nagain and again. So stop thinking about your \\nbusiness, about the oˆce, or about anything \\nthat isn™t happening right now. Don™t chew your \\nworries, your fear, or your anger. If you chew \\nyour planning and your anxiety, it™s diˆcult to \\nfeel grateful for each piece of food. Just chew \\nyour food.\\nA36B Nourished by the Practice\\nTry to be present with your food and with the \\npeople sitting around the table with you. Don™t \\nclose your eyes or look down while you chew. \\nYou can open your eyes and if you are with \\npeople, notice them alive and well. When we \\nchew with awareness, we™re not just nourished \\nby the food, we™re nourished by our practice of \\nmindfulness, peace, and happiness. While we \\nchew, we breathe and we enjoy our breathing \\nand our ability to eat and receive nourishment \\nfrom our food.\\nA37B Food as Medicine \\nIn the original Five Contemplations as they \\nwere recited during the Buddha™s time, food \\nwas considered to be medicine. But I think that \\nwhen the Buddha received good food, he also \\nenjoyed it. I don™t think he thought of it as just \\ntaking medicine. We know the food nourishes \\nour bodies. But we can also appreciate and \\nsavor our food.\\nA38B Healing\\nWhen we eat mindfully, we consume exactly \\nwhat we need in order to keep our bodies, our \\nminds, and the Earth healthy. When we prac\\n-tice like this, we reduce su˙ering for ourselves \\nand for others. We begin to heal ourselves \\nand can help heal the world. As a spiritual \\nfamily and as the human family, we can all help \\nmake our lives more sustainable by following \\nthis practice. \\nA39B Turning off the Radio\\nIn order to eat with joy, we have to turn o˙ \\nﬁRadio NSTﬂ: Non-Stop Thinking. Even if our \\nbodies are sitting still while we eat, usually \\nour minds are racing. In order to truly be pres\\n-ent for our meal, we have to stop the constant \\ninternal dialogue. To eat without thinking is \\nto eat in freedom. We are free because we™re \\nnot thinking about the past, the future, and our \\nprojects. We are free to be sitting, whether \\nalone or with loved ones, and enjoying \\nour meal. \\nA40\\nB Our Ancestors \\n Are in the Soil\\nThat nut, fruit, vegetable, or grain that you eat \\nhas pulled up nutrition from the soil in order \\nto grow. In the soil are many people who \\nhave died, have been transformed, and have \\nbecome part of the soil. Maybe in this mouthful \\nof rice are also the bones of many hundreds \\nof generations as well as many dead leaves, \\nworms, and animals™ bones. Maybe in a previ\\n-ous life you had been there and died there, \\nand your own bones have disintegrated in that \\nland. During the time of eating, your practice \\nis to look deeply into that grain of rice and \\nenjoy all that has gone into its creation. There \\nare so many things to enjoy and to discover in \\neach bite.\\nA42B Eating Mindfully \\n Is a Practice \\nWhen we eat our meal, we should show up \\nfor that meal 100 percent. Eating mindfully is a \\npractice. If we choose to drink a cup of tea in \\nmindfulness, the pleasure of drinking tea will \\nmore than double because we are truly there \\nand the tea is also truly there. Life is real; it™s \\nnot a dream when mindfulness is there. \\nA43B Eating in Silence\\nSometimes, it can be helpful to have a silent \\nmeal to help us practice mindful eating. That \\nway, we can focus our attention on our breath, \\nthe food, and the company around us in order \\nto become fully present in the here and now. \\nA45B Eating a String Bean\\nHold up a string bean and take a moment \\nto see that it is a string bean with the whole \\nworld in it. There are clouds, sunshine, \\nthe whole Earth, and the hard work of the \\ngardener. When we can see like that, we \\nhave wisdom. When we have wisdom, it \\nmeans that we have mindfulness and con\\n-centration. Don™t chew your worries, your \\nsu˙ering, or your projects. That™s not good \\nfor your heath. Just chew the string bean.\\nA46B Nourished by the \\npresent moment \\nIn our daily activities, we often rush from one \\nthing to another. In between tasks we spend \\nour time planning how we™ll accomplish future \\ntasks. In all that hurrying and strategizing, we \\nbecome isolated from the present moment. \\nEating is a chance to return to the present mo\\n-ment and stop the rushing and the planning. \\nA47B How the Buddha Ate\\nEating meditation is a practice that dates back \\nvery far. During his lifetime, the Buddha ate \\nwith his community of monks and nuns. Each \\nday they ate together in silence, nourished by \\nthe food and by the presence of their brothers \\nand sisters in the practice. I don™t think they \\nwere worrying about their schedule or about \\nthe past or the future. I think they just enjoyed \\nbeing together and eating well. We can eat \\nlike that too.\\nA48B The Value of a Meal\\nWe should re˚ect deeply on what we buy and \\nwhat we eat. What we buy and eat can con\\n-tribute to climate change or it can help stop it. \\nEating is a chance to nourish our bodies and \\nknow that we are not destroying the Earth by \\ndoing so.\\nThe value of a meal is not just determined \\nby the amount of money we™ve spent on the \\ningredients or on a meal at a restaurant. There \\nis so much hard work that goes into growing, \\nharvesting, distributing, and cooking even a \\ndish of rice. A good meal doesn™t have to mean \\nit contains expensive ingredients. The best \\nfood is often very simple. There are things the \\ngrocery store can™t provide us with. No matter \\nhow much money you have, you can™t buy it. \\nIt™s only with mindfulness, concentration, and \\ninsight that you can get a truly rich meal.\\nA51B Sitting While You Eat\\nSometimes we are rushing so much in our day \\nthat we eat only as we™re running from one \\nplace to another. We eat in our car or as we \\nwalk. Please sit when you eat. When you sit, \\nthat is a reminder to stop. You have nothing to \\ndo, nowhere to go. \\nA52B One Mindful Breath\\nIt takes only one moment to take a mind\\n-ful in-breath and out-breath before you eat. \\nBring the mind back to the body. Your body is \\nalways available for you. You can bring your \\nattention out of your head and into your body. \\nBefore you focus on the food, focus on being \\npresent with your body: ﬁBreathing in, I am \\naware that my body is still there. Breathing out, \\nI smile to my body.ﬂ This body has been given \\nto us by our parents and those before them. \\nWhen this body was just born, it was very light. \\nAs we grow, we tend to get weighed down by \\nworries and lose our freshness and beauty. \\nMindful eating helps us regain this freshness, \\nnourishing our spirits as well as our bodies. \\nEating with appreciation of our own bodies, we \\neat with more relaxation and joy.\\nA53B The Right Amount\\nWhen we take a moment to sit and breathe \\nbefore we eat, we can get in touch with the \\nreal hunger in our body. We can discover if \\nwe™re eating because we™re hungry or if we™re \\neating because it™s the time to eat and the \\nfood is there. If we™re paying attention and \\ntaking our time, we also know how much to \\neat. Mindfulness is recognizing what is there in \\nthe present moment. What is there is the fact \\nthat you are still alive and your health is still \\nthere. The food in front of you is available to \\nhelp nourish your body and keep you healthy.\\nA54B A Silent Meal\\nHappiness is possible during the meal, and \\nsilence helps enormously. You may want to \\npick one meal a week to eat in silence. A silent \\nmeal helps you come back to yourself and \\narrive in the present moment. A truly silent \\nmeal includes turning o˙ the noise in your \\nhead as well as ˜nding a quiet place to enjoy \\nyour meal. You may like to choose to eat the \\nsame meal every week silently. This can be a \\nmeal you eat by yourself or, if you have family \\nor friends who want to join you for this meal, \\nthat is wonderful. Silence helps you return \\nto your mindful breathing. You can stop the \\ninternal mental chatter, relax, breathe, and \\nsmile. Such a meal can provide many moments \\nof happiness.\\nA55B A Meal at Google\\nWhen I visited Google, I shared a silent meal \\nwith some of the people who work there. \\nAfterward, they wrote me and said, ﬁNever \\nbefore in that cafeteria have I had a meal that \\nwonderful. I was so happy. I felt so peaceful. \\nNobody said anything in that whole room \\nfull of people. Everybody was quiet from the \\nbeginning to the end of the meal. In the history \\nof Google, that™s the ˜rst such meal we™ve \\never had.ﬂ \\nA56B Arranging a Meal\\nYou can arrange your schedule so you have \\nenough time to eat. The place and the food \\nshould be appropriate. What we eat is very \\nimportant. Tell me what you eat and I will tell \\nyou who you are. Tell me where you eat, and I \\nwill tell you who you are. \\nWe are what we consume. If we look \\ndeeply into what and how much we consume \\nevery day, we™ll come to know our own nature \\nvery well. We have to eat, drink, and consume, \\nbut if we do it unmindfully, we may destroy \\nour body and our consciousness. A meal is \\nan opportunity to show gratitude to those that \\ncame before us and those that will come after \\nwe are gone.\\nEating Is an Art\\nEating well is an art. It doesn™t require fancy \\ncooking, but it does require practice and \\nconcentration. Your body is not just yours. It is \\na gift and a responsibility. To keep it healthy, \\nwe need to know how to eat.\\nA58B choosing what to eat\\nOur way of eating and producing food can \\nbe very violent, to other species, to our \\nown bodies, and to the Earth. Or our way of \\ngrowing, distributing, and eating food can \\nbe part of creating a larger healing. We get \\nto choose.\\nThe planet su˙ers deeply because of the \\nway many of us eat now. Forests are razed to \\ngrow grain to feed livestock, and the way the \\nanimals are raised pollutes our water and air. \\nA lot of grain and water is also used to make \\nalcohol. Tens of thousands of children die of \\nstarvation and malnutrition every day, even \\nthough our Earth has the ability to feed us all. \\nA59B With each meal, we make choices that help \\nor harm the planet. ﬁWhat shall I eat today?ﬂ \\nis a very deep question. You might want to \\nask yourself that question every morning. You \\nmay ˜nd that as you practice mindful eating \\nand begin to look deeply at what you eat \\nand drink, your desire for certain foods may \\nchange. Your happiness and that of the Earth \\nare intertwined.\\nA60B a vegetarian diet\\nThe Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) \\nof the United Nations proposed that the meat \\nindustry be reduced by at least 50 percent \\nin order to save our planet. The simple act of \\nbecoming vegetarian can make a di˙erence in \\nthe health of our planet. \\nIf you™re not able to entirely stop eating \\nmeat, you can still decide to make an \\ne˙ort to cut back. By cutting meat out of \\nyour diet even ˜ve or ten days a month, \\nyou™re already helping. Try to reduce your \\nconsumption by at least 50 percent. This \\nbegins to nourish your compassion. If you \\nknow that you™re living in a way that makes a \\nfuture possible for your planet, you™ll have joy. \\nA61B The Planet Is Us \\nOur food comes from this beautiful planet. The \\nEarth is inside of us, in each morsel of food, in \\nthe air we breathe, in the water that we drink \\nand that ˚ows through us. Enjoy being part of \\nthe Earth and eat in such a way that allows you \\nto be aware that each bite is deepening your \\nconnection to the planet. \\nA62B Bon Appétit!\\nBefore eating, we wish people will have a \\ngood appetite. We say ﬁbon appétit,ﬂ just as \\nbefore going to sleep we say ﬁgood night.ﬂ In \\nVietnamese, they say ﬁplease have a sweet, \\ndelicious sleep.ﬂ In Vietnamese, the word \\nﬁdeliciousﬂ always goes together with the word \\nﬁhealthy.ﬂ So delicious food must be healthy \\nfood. We eat delicious food in order to have \\nstrength and good health. Food that is tasty \\nbut destroys our bodies and our minds is \\nnot healthy. \\nWhen you eat with mindfulness, you \\nconsume deliciously. If you don™t feel happy, \\nif you don™t feel good enough, then you have \\nto inquire of those who™ve practiced a long \\ntime, ﬁCan you help me? How can I taste the \\nmoment deliciously?ﬂ \\nA63B Attention to What We Eat\\nBefore eating, you may see a condiment dish \\nwith red chili peppers. It looks very appealing. \\nBut when you look deeper, you know you are \\nsensitive to them, and if you eat them they \\nmay a˙ect your digestion. So although they™re \\ndelicious, they may not be healthy for you. \\nSomething can be delicious and not healthy, \\nso we have to be very careful about what we \\nprepare and what we eat. Healthy is good, but \\nhealthy and not delicious isn™t good either. You \\nhave to have both. \\nA64B Bound by a Hundred Strings\\nEating is a practice. The practice must be \\nnourishing for us, for our bodies, and also for \\nour minds. If you eat but you are bound by a \\nhundred strings of worries, anger, irritation, \\nstress, and projects, then these one hundred \\nstrings are pulling you in one hundred dir\\n-ections. Your food and your experience of \\neating will be empty and worthless. So you \\nhave to plan properly and have the intention \\nthat whenever you eat, you eat in freedom.\\nA65B Meditation as Food\\nMeditation practice is also a kind of food \\nbecause it nourishes us. Consider the practice \\no˙ered by the Buddha to be a kind of food. \\nAny practice must be a kind of food. Walking \\nis like a delicious food. Eating is a delicious \\nfood, sitting is a delicious food, and working \\nmeditation is also delicious food. \\nA66B What a Baby Eats \\nOften when I am giving a talk, a few babies will \\nbe in the audience, and some of them will be \\nnursing. The infants don™t know what a bell is; \\nthey don™t understand the word ﬁmindfulness,ﬂ \\nbut they are nourished both by their mother™s \\nbodies as well as by the sounds of the bell and \\nthe talk. They can feel the collective energy \\nof deep peace as everyone breathes in and \\nout. They are getting many di˙erent kinds of \\nnourishing foodŠthe milk from their mothers, \\nthe sounds of the bell, and the collective \\nenergy of mindfulness all around them.\\nA67B Organizing a Meal\\nWe can organize a meal in such a way that it \\ncan really be a time of practice. A meal can \\nnourish and heal, be delicious, and also help \\ncreate a peaceful atmosphere. We have many \\npeople who are very good at organizing. They \\nget a lot done during the day. But sometimes \\nthey forget to eat! They don™t organize their \\nday to include mindful meals. Organizing a \\nmeal requires making the time to eat, without \\ndistractions and worries. Eat in a way that is \\nrelaxing and brings you joy. It doesn™t take too \\nmuch organizing and the results are profound. \\nA69B Eating and Smiling\\nSitting at the table and eating with other \\npeople is a chance to o˙er an authentic smile \\nof friendship and understanding. It™s very easy, \\nbut not many people do it. To me, the most \\nimportant part of the practice is to look at each \\nperson and smile. When family or community \\nmembers sit together and cannot smile at each \\nother, the situation is a very dangerous one.\\nUpon ˜nishing your meal, take a few moments \\nto notice that you have ˜nished, that your bowl \\nis now empty, and your hunger is satis˜ed. \\nThis is another opportunity to smile and be \\ngrateful that you have had this nourishing food \\nto eat, supporting you on the path of love \\nand understanding. \\nA70B Eating with Children \\n in Silence\\nSometimes parents who might want to enjoy a \\nsilent meal think that their children will not be \\nable to enjoy or participate in the silence. But \\nchildren are very capable of eating in silence \\nfor ˜ve, ten, or even twenty minutes and can \\nenjoy it very much. \\nA71B Cultivating Compassion\\nHaving the opportunity to sit with our family \\nand friends and enjoy wonderful food is \\nsomething precious, something not everyone \\nhas. Many people in the world are hungry. \\nWhen I hold a bowl of warm, nutritous food, I \\nknow that I™m fortunate, and I feel compassion \\nfor all those who don™t have enough to eat \\nand who are without friends or family. Right \\nat the dinner table, we can cultivate the \\nseeds of compassion that will strengthen \\nour determination to help hungry and lonely \\npeople be nourished. \\nA72B Mindful Conversation \\n at Mealtime\\nI don™t recommend that all meals be silent. I \\nthink talking to each other is a wonderful way \\nto be in touch. But we have to distinguish \\nbetween di˙erent kinds of talk.\\n Some subjects \\ncan separate us, for instance, if we talk about \\nother people™s shortcomings.\\n The food that \\nhas been prepared carefully will have no \\nvalue if we let this kind of talk dominate our \\nmeal. Instead we can speak about things that \\nnourish our awareness of the food and our \\nbeing together, cultivating happiness. \\nRefrain from discussing subjects that can \\ndestroy your awareness of the people around \\nyou and the food. If someone is thinking about \\nsomething other than the good food on the \\nA73B table, such as his diˆculties in the oˆce or \\nwith friends, it means he is losing the present \\nmoment and the food. You can help by \\nreturning his attention to the meal. \\nA74B Inviting the Bell \\n at Mealtime\\nIn our practice centers, we invite the bell \\nthree times before eating, and then we eat \\nin silence for about twenty minutes. Eating \\nin silence, we are fully aware of our food™s \\nnourishment for body and mind. In order to \\ndeepen our practice of mindful eating and \\nsupport the peaceful atmosphere, we remain \\nseated during this silent period. At the end of \\nthis time, two sounds of the bell will be invited. \\nWe may then start a mindful conversation with \\nour friends or begin getting up from the table.\\nThe Purpose of Breakfast\\nA few years ago, I asked some children, ﬁWhat \\nis the purpose of eating breakfast?ﬂ One boy \\nreplied, ﬁTo get energy for the day.ﬂ Another \\nsaid, ﬁThe purpose of eating breakfast is to \\neat breakfast.ﬂ I think the second child is more \\ncorrect. The purpose of eating is to eat.\\nA77B A Full Life \\nIf we feel empty, we don™t need to go to the \\nrefrigerator to take things out to eat. When you \\neat like that it™s because there is a feeling of \\nemptiness, loneliness, or depression inside. \\nThe moments of our daily lives can be ˜lled \\nwith joy and meaningful activities. Our com\\n-munity includes our family and friends and our \\nconnection to other living beings. They are \\nthere to help us get out of these feelings. We \\nare not alone. Sharing a meal together is not \\njust to sustain our bodies and celebrate life™s \\nwonders, but also to experience freedom, joy, \\nand the happiness of being in a harmonious \\ncommunity during the whole time of eating.\\nA78B Getting Support\\nSuppose you have trouble with eating. You eat \\nmore than you need to and that has brought \\nyou a lot of diˆculties and su˙ering. One way \\nto return to joyful eating is to make a com\\n-mitment to eat with others who support you. \\nTaking refuge in your community can help \\na lot. We all need a community to help us in \\nour practice. Even if you live alone and don™t \\nhave a community to practice with, you are \\nnot really alone. Many hands have gone into \\nmaking the food you™re eating. There are the \\nmicrobes and bacteria and other microscopic \\nliving things that are in your food, in you, and \\nall around you. Your ancestors as well as your \\ndescendants are with you in every cell of \\nyour being. \\nA79B Truly Seeing \\nWhen we look at the people we™re eating with, \\nwe can see them fully in just a few moments. \\nWe don™t need two hours to be able to see \\nanother person. If we are really settled within \\nourselves, we only need to look for a few \\nseconds, and that is enough to see our friend. \\nI think that if a family has ˜ve members, only \\nabout ˜ve or ten seconds is needed to prac\\n-tice this ﬁlooking and seeing.ﬂ\\nA80B Enjoying dishwashing\\nAs novices, we had to wash dishes for one \\nhundred monks. There was no running waterŠ\\nno cold water, no hot water, no tap water at \\nall, and no soap. You may wonder how we \\nmanaged to wash the dishes! We had only \\nashes, rice husks, and a coconut skin to use as \\na sponge. Many people in my country still use \\nthis. You take a layer of coconut skin and dry \\nit to make into implements for cleaning pots \\nand pans. We had to heat up a big pot of water \\nbefore we could do any scrubbing. As a novice, \\nI had to go out and gather wood in the pine-\\ncovered hills. We gathered dead branches and \\npine needles into a big heap. You can cook \\nrice or soup with just pine needles.\\nA81B We were just two novices washing the \\ndishes for one hundred monks. It was a lot \\nof fun washing dishes together, even without \\nhot running water and soap. Some countries \\nhave modern homes that are very comfortable. \\nThe water, hot and cold, comes right into the \\nkitchen; you have only to turn on the tap.\\nYou can stand there and enjoy washing \\ndishes. But maybe you are lazy. You see a big \\npile of dishes and you don™t want to go over \\nand wash them. But as soon as you roll up \\nyour sleeves and stand in front of the basin, it \\nis not diˆcult anymore.\\nWhether you are living in a modern country, \\nor you have only a well for water, you can still \\nenjoy washing the dishes.\\nA83B Dishwashing as Meditation\\nSuppose the baby BuddhaŠor the baby \\nMohammed, the baby Moses, or the baby \\nJesusŠhad just been born. You would want \\nto bathe him with clean water. Wash every \\nbowl, every dish as if you are bathing a babyŠ\\nbreathing in, feeling joy; breathing out, smiling.\\nEvery minute can be a holy, sacred minute. \\nWhere do you seek the spiritual? You seek \\nthe spiritual in every ordinary thing that you do \\nevery day. Sweeping the ˚oor, watering the \\nvegetables, and washing the dishes become \\nholy and sacred if mindfulness is there. With \\nmindfulness and concentration, everything \\nbecomes spiritual.\\nA84B DRINKING A CLOUD\\nSomething as simple and ordinary as drinking \\na cup of tea can bring us great joy and help us \\nfeel our connection to the Earth. The way we \\ndrink our tea can transform our lives if we truly \\ndevote our attention to it.\\nSometimes we hurry through our daily \\ntasks, looking forward to the time when we \\ncan stop and have a cup of tea. But then when \\nwe™re ˜nally sitting with the cup in our hands, \\nour mind is still running o˙ into the future and \\nwe can™t enjoy what we™re doing; we lose the \\npleasure of drinking our tea. We need to keep \\nour awareness alive and value each moment \\nof our daily life. We may think our other tasks \\nare less pleasant than drinking tea. But if we \\ndo them with awareness, we may ˜nd that \\nthey™re actually very enjoyable.\\nA85B Drinking a cup of tea is a pleasure we can \\ngive ourselves every day. To enjoy our tea, we \\nhave to be fully present and know clearly and \\ndeeply that we are drinking tea.\\nWhen you lift your cup, you may like to \\nbreathe in the aroma. Looking deeply into \\nyour tea, you see that you are drinking fragrant \\nplants that are the gift of Mother Earth. You \\nsee the labor of the tea pickers; you see the \\nluscious tea ˜elds and plantations in Sri Lanka, \\nChina, and Vietnam. You know that you are \\ndrinking a cloud; you are drinking the rain. The \\ntea contains the whole universe.\\nA86B Snack Meditation\\nA young friend once asked me to teach him \\nabout the practice of mindfulness. I o˙ered \\nhim a tangerine, but he continued telling me \\nabout his many projectsŠhis work for peace, \\nsocial justice, and so on. While he was eating, \\nhe was thinking and talking. He peeled the \\ntangerine and tossed the sections into his \\nmouth and quickly chewed and swallowed.\\nI said, ﬁJim, stop! Eat your tangerine.ﬂ He \\nlooked at me and understood. So he stopped \\ntalking and began to eat much more slowly \\nand mindfully. He separated each of the \\nremaining sections, smelled their beautiful \\nfragrance, put one section at a time into his \\nmouth, and felt all the juices surrounding \\nhis tongue. What is the purpose of eating a \\nA87B tangerine? It is to eat the tangerine. During the \\ntime you eat a tangerine, eating that tangerine \\nis the most important thing in your life.\\nThe next time you have a tangerine, please \\nput it in the palm of your hand and look at it in \\na way that makes the tangerine real. You don™t \\nneed a lot of time; just two or three seconds is \\nenough. Looking at it, you will see the beauti\\n-ful tangerine blossom with sunshine and rain, \\nand the tiny tangerine fruit forming. You can \\nsee the baby fruit grow and its color change \\nfrom green to orange. Peeling the tangerine, \\nsmelling and tasting it, you can be very happy. \\nEverything we do can be like this. Whether \\nplanting lettuce, washing dishes, writing a \\npoem, or adding columns of numbers, we can \\ndo it with concentration and awareness.\\nA88B the right amount\\nMindfulness of eating helps us to know what \\nand how much we should eat. We should take \\nonly what we can eat. We tend to ignore the \\nrule of moderation. Many of us should take \\nless than what we™re used to eating every day. \\nWe see that people who consume less are \\nhealthier and more joyful, and that those who \\nconsume a lot may su˙er very deeply. If we \\nchew carefully, if we eat only what is healthy, \\nthen we won™t bring sickness into our body or \\nour mind.\\nA89B Snacking\\nIf we are hungry, a little snack can be very \\nsatisfying. But often we develop a habit of \\neating a snack whenever we feel loneliness \\nor anxiety. A mindful breath is a good way for \\nyour body to ﬁsnackﬂ on some mindfulness \\nand recognize and embrace strong feelings \\nthat may be there. After a mindful breath, you \\nmay have less desire to go and ˜ll up with a \\nsnack to distract yourself. Your body is nour\\n-ished by your breath.\\nA90B Eating our Feelings\\nWe human beings have many feelings, both \\npositive and negative. Some people tend to \\neat more when they™re joyful, while others tend \\nto eat less. Some people eat when they are \\nsad or upset as a way of eating their feelings, \\nhoping the feelings will go away.  Food \\nbecomes a craving then, rather than a source \\nof nourishment. If we don™t attempt to look \\ndeeply to understand our craving, it will grow. \\nWhen we take the time to take care of our \\nemotions with mindfulness and compassion, \\nthen we can just eat. We can enjoy our food \\nwithout craving and develop a healthy and \\npositive relationship to eating.\\nA91B Nourishing Ourselves \\n with Mindfulness \\nWe all know that sometimes we open the \\nrefrigerator and take out an item that is not \\ngood for our health. We are intelligent enough \\nto recognize that. But still we go ahead and \\neat it to try to cover up the uneasiness within \\nourselvesŠwe consume to forget our worries \\nand our anxieties and to repress negative \\nenergies like fear and anger. Instead of con\\n-suming when a feeling of anxiety comes up, \\ninvite the energy of mindfulness to manifest. \\nPractice mindful walking and mindful breathing \\nto generate the energy of mindfulness, and \\ninvite that energy up to take care of the energy \\nthat™s making you su˙er. If we can practice like \\nthis, we™ll have enough of the energy of mind\\n-fulness to take care of our fear, our anger, and \\nother negative energies.\\nA92B Mindful Consumption \\n Is for Everyone \\nEating mindfully is a practice that supports \\nourselves, our families, our society, and the \\nplanet, and it is something everyone of any \\nage can do. Leaders of organizations and \\ncommunities can model responsible and \\ncompassionate eating. If you are a mayor, a \\ngovernor, or a president, you may want to \\nencourage the people you govern to engage \\nin mindful consumption so that you can reduce \\nthe violence and su˙ering in your community.\\nA93B The Joy of Eating\\nEating should be very joyful. When I pick up \\nmy food with my chopsticks, with my spoon \\nor fork, or with my hands, I take time to look \\nat it for a moment before I put it in my mouth. \\nIf I am really present, I will recognize the food \\nright away, whether it is an apple, a radish, or a \\npiece of potato. I smile to it, put it in my mouth, \\nand chew with complete awareness of what I \\nam eating. I chew my food in such a way that \\nlife, joy, solidity, and nonfear become possible. \\nAfter eating, I feel nourished, not only \\nphysically, but also mentally and spiritually. \\nA95B Contemplations \\nfor Eating\\nA96B Contemplating our meal\\nContemplating our food for a few moments \\nbefore eating can bring us much happiness. \\nWe look at the food in a way that the food \\nbecomes real. We think about all the people, \\nanimals, plants, and minerals and all the condi\\n-tions that brought the food to our plate. The \\nfood reveals our connection with the Earth \\nand all beings. We remember our determina\\n-tion to eat in a way that preserves our health \\nand well-being and the health and well-being \\nof the Earth. The following contemplations \\nand verses can help us practice mindfulness \\nwhile eating.\\nA97B Practicing with The Five \\nContemplations\\nThe Five Contemplations can be said before \\na meal to remind us to be fully present for our \\nmeal and enjoy it. You can print them out and \\nread them aloud, or you can memorize them. \\nThen they become truly a part of your meal.\\nBut the Five Contemplations aren™t just for \\nreading or reciting before the meal. Otherwise, \\nthey can become like something we simply \\ncheck o˙ before we eat, but then\\n we continue \\nto eat as we always have, carried away by \\nour thinking. Throughout the meal, try to live \\nthe Five Contemplations. When you practice \\neating mindfully, you are worthy of the food. \\nThe food that has come to your plate is the \\nresult of a lot of love and hard work.\\nA98B The Five Contemplations \\n1. \\n This food is a gift of the Earth, the sky, \\nnumerous living beings, and much hard and \\nloving work.\\n2. \\n May we eat with mindfulness and gratitude \\nso as to be worthy to receive this food.\\n3. \\n May we recognize and transform unwhole\\n-some mental formations, especially our \\ngreed, and learn to eat with moderation.\\nA99B 4. \\n May we keep our compassion alive by eat\\n-ing in such a way that reduces the su˙ering \\nof living beings,ˇstops contributing to climate \\nchange, and heals and preserves our pre\\n-cious planet.\\n5. \\n We accept this food so that we may nurture \\nour brotherhood and sisterhood, build our \\ncommunity,ˇand nourish our ideal of serving \\nall living beings.\\nA100\\nB A Gift of the Earth \\nTHE FIRST CONTEMPLATION: \\nThis food is a gift \\nof the Earth, the sky, numerous living beings, \\nand much hard and loving work.\\nThe ˜rst contemplation makes us aware that \\nour food comes directly from the Earth and \\nsky. It is a gift of the Earth and sky, and also \\nof the people who prepared it. There is a lot \\nof loving work that goes into making a meal. \\nThis contemplation puts you in touch with the \\ninsight that the one contains the all. When you \\npick up a carrot, you can see right away that \\nthe Earth, the sky, and the whole universe \\nhave come together to make that wonderful \\ncarrot. Many people have done a lot of loving \\nwork and many elements have come together\\n A101\\nB to bring that carrot to your plate. When you put \\nit in your mouth, you can be in touch with the \\nwhole universe. A bunch of beets, a head of \\nlettuce, and a loaf of bread all help you to be in \\ntouch with the love, hard work, and diˆculties \\nthat brought the food to you. Even if you are \\neating by yourself, you are not alone. You are \\npart of a larger community that helped grow \\nthe food. In your food you can see the pre\\n-cious presence and work of so many people. \\nA102\\nB Gratitude\\nTHE SECOND CONTEMPLATION:\\n May we eat \\nwith mindfulness and gratitude so as to be \\nworthy to receive this food.\\nThe second contemplation is about being \\naware of our food™s presence and being \\nthankful for having it. We can™t allow ourselves \\nto get lost in the past or the future. We are \\nthere for the food and our food is there for us; \\nit is only fair. Eat in mindfulness and you will be \\nworthy of the Earth and the sky. \\nWhen we look deeply at the work that goes \\ninto growing and preparing our food, gratitude \\ncomes naturally. So many hands have been \\npart of bringing our food to the table. Eating \\nmindfully is a way of showing appreciation \\nfor all the hard work that has gone into \\nmanifesting this meal. \\nA103\\nB Eating with Moderation\\nTHE THIRD CONTEMPLATION:\\n May we recog-\\nnize and transform unwholesome mental \\nform\\n ations, especially our greed, and learn to \\neat with moderation.\\nThe third contemplation is about becoming \\naware of our negative tendencies and not \\nallowing them to carry us away. We need to \\nlearn how to eat in moderation, to eat the \\nright amount of food. It is very important not to \\novereat. If you eat slowly and chew very care\\n-fully, you will get plenty of nutrition. The right \\namount of food is the amount that helps us \\nstay healthy. \\nThe Buddha was always reminding his \\nmonks to eat with moderation. To eat with \\nmoderation means to have a light, healthy \\nA104\\nB body. Many illnesses come to us through \\nour mouths. So we want to look into what \\nwe eat, and know what we should eat and \\nwhat we should not eat. Look with the eye of \\nthe Buddha. The quality of the food and the \\nquantity of the food is very important. Every \\nmonk and nun traditionally has an alms bowl, \\nwhich is called ﬁthe vessel of appropriate \\nmeasure.ﬂ It helps them know how much food \\nto take. When they™re o˙ered too much food \\nduring the almsround, they give some of it \\nto others. So the bowl helps a lot. We know \\nexactly what quantity of food we want to \\nconsume, as well as the quality. \\nA105\\nB Eating to Reduce Suffering\\nTHE FOURTH CONTEMPLATION:\\n May we \\nkeep our compassion alive by eating in such \\na way that reduces the su˜ering of living \\nbeings,˚stops contributing to climate change, \\nand heals and preserves our precious planet.\\nThe fourth contemplation is about the quality \\nof our food. We are determined to ingest only \\nfood that has no toxins for our body and our \\nconsciousness, food that keeps us healthy \\nand nourishes our compassion. When you eat \\nin such a way that you can keep compassion \\nalive in you, that is mindful eating. \\nSometimes, even if we™re not hungry, we \\neat to cover up the su˙ering inside. We can \\neat in a way that doesn™t cover up su˙ering \\nbut acknowledges it and helps it transform. \\nA106\\nB You may even smile to your own su˙ering, \\nbecause su˙ering has a role to play in helping \\nus transform. Awareness of su˙ering plays a \\nvery important role in helping us to understand \\nsu˙ering and generate the energy of compas\\n-sion. With mindfulness we™re no longer afraid \\nof su˙ering and pain. We learn how to make \\ngood use of the mud of su˙ering to fabricate \\nlotus ˚owers. \\nA107\\nB Nurturing All Beings \\nTHE FIFTH CONTEMPLATION:\\n We accept this \\nfood so that we may nurture our brotherhood \\nand sisterhood, build our community,˚and \\nnourish our ideal of serving all living beings.\\nThe ˜fth contemplation reminds us to be \\naware that we receive food in order to realize \\nsomething. Our lives should have meaning, \\nand that meaning is to help people su˙er less \\nand help them to touch the joys of life. When \\nwe have compassion in our hearts and we \\nknow that we are able to help a person su˙er \\nless, life begins to have more meaning. This \\nis an important source of nourishment for us \\nand can bring us a lot of joy. One individual is \\ncapable of helping many living beings. This is \\nsomething we can do wherever we are.\\nA108\\nB Six Food Contemplations \\nfor Young People \\nIt™s wonderful for families to experience the \\nhappiness of sitting and eating mindfully \\ntogether. These Six Contemplations were \\nwritten particularly to be shared with young \\npeople before a meal, but they can be enjoyed \\nby anybody.\\n1. \\n This food is the gift of the whole universe: \\nthe Earth, the sky, the rain, and the sun.\\n2. \\n We thank the people who have made this \\nfood, especially the farmers, the people at \\nthe market, and the cooks.\\n A109\\nB  3. \\n We only put on our plate as much food as \\nwe can eat.\\n4. \\n We want to chew the food slowly so that we \\ncan enjoy it.\\n5. \\n This food gives us energy to practice being \\nmore loving and understanding.\\n6. \\n We eat this food in order to be healthy and \\nhappy, and to love each other as a family.\\nA110\\nB Serving Food\\nIn this food \\nI see clearly\\nthe presence of the entire universe\\nsupporting my existence.\\nThis verse helps us see that our life and the \\nlives of all species are interrelated. Eating is a \\nvery deep practice. As you wait to serve your\\n-self or be served, look at the food and smile \\nto it. It contains sunshine, clouds, the sky, the \\nEarth, the farmer, everything. \\nLook at a peach deeply. Don™t put it into \\nyour mouth right away. Look at it and smile \\nto it, and if you are mindful you will see the \\nsunshine inside the peach. A cloud is inside. \\nThe great Earth is inside. A lot of love and a lot \\nof hard work are inside. Then, when you eat it, \\nA111B please be sure to chew only the peach, and \\nnot your projects or your worries. Enjoy eating \\nyour peach. The peach is a miracle. You, also, \\nare a miracle. So spend time with your food; \\nevery minute of your meal should be happy. \\nNot many people have the time and the \\nopportunity to sit down and enjoy a meal like \\nthat. We are very fortunate.\\nA112\\nB Looking at Your Plate\\nThis plate of food,\\nso fragrant and appetizing,\\nalso contains much su˜ering.\\nThis verse has its roots in a Vietnamese folk\\n-song. When we look at our plate, ˜lled with \\nfragrant and appetizing food, we should be \\naware of the bitter pain of people who su˙er \\nfrom hunger. Every day, thousands of children \\ndie from hunger and malnutrition. Looking at \\nour plate, we can see Mother Earth, the farm \\nworkers, and the tragedy of the unequal distri\\n-bution of food.\\nWe who live in North America and Europe \\nare accustomed to eating foods imported \\nfrom other countries, whether it is co˙ee from \\nColombia, chocolate from Ghana, or fragrant \\nA113\\nB rice from Thailand. Many children in these \\ncountries, except those from rich families, \\nnever see the ˜ne products that are put aside \\nfor export in order to bring in money. Some \\nparents are so poor and starving they have to \\nsell their children as servants to families who \\nhave enough to eat.\\nBefore a meal, we can join our palms in \\nmindfulness and think about those who do not \\nhave enough to eat. Slowly and mindfully, we \\nbreathe three times and recite this gatha, or \\nverse. Doing so will help us maintain mindful\\n-ness. May we ˜nd ways to live more simply in \\norder to have more time and energy to change \\nthe system of injustice that exists in the world.\\nA114\\nB Beginning to Eat\\nWith the ˚rst mouthful, I practice \\nthe love that brings joy.\\nWith the second mouthful, I practice \\nthe love that relieves su˜ering.\\nWith the third mouthful, I practice \\nthe joy of being alive.\\nWith the fourth mouthful, I practice \\nequal love for all beings.\\nDuring the time we eat the ˜rst mouthful, \\nwe express our gratitude by promising to \\nbring joy to at least one person. With the \\nsecond mouthful, we can promise to help \\nrelieve the pain of at least one person. With \\nthe third mouthful, we are in touch with the \\nwonders of life. With the fourth mouthful, \\nA115\\nB we practice inclusiveness and the love that \\nis characterized by nondiscrimination. After \\nthis, we get in touch with the food and its \\ndeep nature.\\nA116\\nB Looking at Your \\n Empty Bowl\\nMy bowl, empty now,\\nwill soon be ˚lled with precious food.\\nBeings all over the Earth are struggling to live.\\nHow fortunate we are to have enough to eat.\\nWhen many people on this Earth look at an \\nempty bowl, they know their bowl will continue \\nto be empty for a long time. So the empty bowl \\nis as important to honor as the full bowl. We \\nare grateful to have food to eat and we can \\n˜nd ways to help those who are hungry.\\nA117\\nB Finishing Your Meal\\nMy bowl is empty.\\nMy hunger is satis˚ed.\\nI vow to live\\nfor the bene˚t of all beings.\\nAfter eating, don™t rush on to the next thing. \\nInstead, spend a moment being grateful for \\nthe food you have just eaten and all that came \\ntogether to create this moment. Sometimes \\nwe show our gratitude only before we eat, \\nand then after the meal we move on. But \\nwe are as grateful for having eaten and for \\nfeeling satis˜ed as we are in the moments of \\ncontemplation before we eat. Living peacefully \\nand happily is the best way to show our \\ngratitude and is our greatest gift for the world \\nand the next generation. \\nA118\\nB Holding Your Cup of Tea\\nThis cup of tea in my two hands,\\nmindfulness is held perfectly.\\nMy mind and body dwell\\nin the very here and now.\\nWherever you are drinking your tea, whether \\nat work or in a café or at home, it is wonder\\n-ful to allow enough time to appreciate it. If the \\nweather is cold, you can feel the warmth of the \\ncup in your hands. Breathe in and recite the \\n˜rst line; breathe out and recite the second. \\nThe next inhalation is for the third line, and the \\nnext exhalation is for the fourth line. Breathing \\nmindfully in this way, we recuperate ourselves \\nand the cup of tea reclaims its highest place. If \\nwe™re not mindful, it™s not tea that we™re drink\\n-ing but our own illusions and a˘ictions. If the \\ntea becomes real, we become real. When we \\nare able to truly meet the tea, at that very mo\\n-ment we are truly alive. \\nA120\\nB bathing a baby\\nWashing the dishes\\nis like bathing a baby Buddha.\\nThe profane is the sacred.\\nEveryday mind is Buddha mind.\\nWhen you are cleaning the kitchen or washing \\nthe dishes, do it as if you were cleaning \\nan altar or washing a baby. Washing in this \\nway, joy and peace can radiate within and \\naround you. The idea that doing dishes is \\nunpleasant can occur to us only when we \\nare not doing them. Once we™re standing in \\nfront of the sink with our sleeves rolled up \\nand our hands in warm water, it™s really not \\nbad at all. I enjoy taking my time with each \\nA121\\nB dish, being fully aware of the dish, the water, \\nand each movement of my hands. I know that \\nif I hurry in order to go and have dessert or \\na cup of tea, the time of dishwashing\\n will be \\nunpleasant. That would be a pity, because the \\ndishes themselves and the fact that I am here \\nwashing them are both miracles!\\nIf I am incapable of washing dishes joyfully, \\nif I want to ˜nish them quickly so I can go and \\nhave dessert and a cup of tea, I will be equally \\nincapable of doing these other things joyfully. \\nWith the cup in my hands, I will be thinking \\nabout what to do next, and the fragrance and \\n˚avor of the tea, together with the pleasure of \\ndrinking it, will be lost. I will always be dragged \\ninto the future, never able to live in the present \\nmoment. The time of dishwashing is as \\nimportant as any other time.\\nA122\\nB Composting our \\n Food Scraps\\nIn the garbage, I see a rose.\\nIn the rose, I see the garbage.\\nEverything is in transformation. \\nEven permanence is impermanent.\\nWhenever we throw food in the compost, it \\ncan smell bad. Rotting organic matter smells \\nespecially badly. But it can also become rich \\ncompost for fertilizing the garden. The fragrant \\nrose and the stinking garbage are two sides \\nof the same existence. Without one, the other \\ncannot be. Everything is in transformation. The \\nrose that wilts after six days will become a part \\nof the compost. After six months the compost  \\nis transformed into a rose. \\nA124\\nB a way out\\nI know the Earth is my Mother,\\na great living being.\\nI vow to protect the Earth,\\nand the Earth protects me.\\nWe practice eating mindfully not just to heal \\nourselves and our loved ones, but as a way to \\nhelp the world out of the diˆcult situation we \\nare in. We become aware of what to consume \\nand what not to consume in order to keep our \\nbodies, our minds, and the Earth healthy, and \\nnot to cause su˙ering for ourselves and for \\nothers. Mindful consumption is the way out of \\nour diˆculties, not just our personal diˆcul\\n-ties, but also the way out of war, poverty, and \\nA125\\nB climate crisis. The Earth requires now that we \\nconsume mindfully if we are to survive and \\nthrive as a species. \\nParallax Press\\nP.O.
