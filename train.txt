Thick Nhat Hanh 
PEACE IS EVERY STEP 
The Path of Mindfulness in Everyday Life 


Foreword 

BY H. H. THE DALAI LAMA 

Although attempting to bring about world peace through the internal 
transformation of individuals is difficult, it is the only way. Wherever I go, I 
express this, and I am encouraged that people from many different walks of 
life receive it well. Peace must first be developed within an individual. And I 
believe that love, compassion, and altruism are the fundamental basis for 
peace. Once these qualities are developed within an individual, he or she is 
then able to create an atmosphere of peace and harmony. This atmosphere 
can be expanded and extended from the individual to his family, from the 
family to the community and eventually to the whole world. 

Peace Is Every Step is a guidebook for a journey in exactly this direction. 
Thich Nhat Hanh begins by teaching mindfulness of breathing and 
awareness of the small acts of our daily lives, then shows us how to use the 
benefits of mindful-ness and concentration to transform and heal difficult 
psychological states. Finally he shows us the connection between personal, 
inner peace and peace on Earth. This is a very worthwhile book. It can 
change individual lives and the life of our society. 


Editors Introduction 

As I walked slowly and mindfully through a green oak forest this 
morning, a brilliant red-orange sun rose on the horizon. It immediately 
evoked for me images of India, where a group of us joined Thich Nhat Hanh 
the year before last to visit the sites where the Buddha taught. On one walk 
to a cave near Bodh Gaya, we stopped in a field surrounded by rice paddies 
and recited this poem: 

Peace is every step. 

The shining red sun is my heart. 

Each flower smiles with me. 

How green, how fresh all that grows. 


How cool the wind blows. 

Peace is every step. 

It turns the endless path to joy. 

These lines summarize the essence of Thich Nhat Hanh’s message — that 
peace is not external or to be sought after or attained. Living mindfully, 
slowing down and enjoying each step and each breath, is enough. Peace is 
already present in each step, and if we walk in this way, a flower will bloom 
under our feet with every step. In fact the flowers will smile at us and wish 
us well on our way. 

I met Thich Nhat Hanh in 1982 when he attended the Reverence for Life 
conference in New York. I was one of the first American Buddhists he had 
met, and it fascinated him that I looked, dressed, and, to some extent, acted 
like the novices he had trained in Vietnam for two decades. When my 
teacher, Richard Baker-roshi, invited him to visit our meditation center in 
San Francisco the following year, he happily accepted, and this began a new 
phase in the extraordinary life of this gentle monk, whom Baker-roshi 
characterized as “a cross between a cloud, a snail, and a piece of heavy 
machinery — a true religious presence.” 

Thich Nhat Hanh was born in central Vietnam in 1926 and was ordained a 
Buddhist monk in 1942, at the age of sixteen, first eight years later, he 
co-founded what was to become the foremost center of Buddhist studies in 
South Vietnam, the An Quang Buddhist Institute. 

In 1961, Nhat Hanh came to the United States to study and teach 
comparative religion at Columbia and Princeton Universities. But in 1963, 
his monk-colleagues in Vietnam telegrammed him to come home to join 
them in their work to stop the war following the fall of the oppressive Diem 
regime. He immediately returned and helped lead one of the great 
nonviolent resistance movements of the century, based entirely on Gandhian 
principles. 

In 1964, along with a group of university professors and students in 
Vietnam, Thich Nhat Hanh founded the School of Youth for Social Service, 
called by the American press the “little Peace Corps,” in which teams of 
young people went into the countryside to establish schools and health 
clinics, and later to rebuild villages that had been bombed. By the time of the 
fall of Saigon, there were more than 10,000 monks, nuns, and young social 
workers involved in the work. In the same year, he helped set up what was to 
become one of the most prestigious publishing houses in Vietnam, La Boi 
Press. In his books and as editor-in-chief of the official publication of the 



Unified Buddhist Church, he called for reconciliation between the warring 
parties in Vietnam, and because of that his writings were censored by both 
opposing governments. 

In 1966, at the urging of his fellow monks, he accepted an invitation from 
the Fellowship of Reconciliation and Cornell University to come to the U.S. 
“to describe to [us] the aspirations and the agony of the voiceless masses of 
the Vietnamese people” (New Yorker, June 25, 1966). He had a densely 
packed schedule of speaking engagements and private meetings, and spoke 
convincingly in favor of a ceasefire and a negotiated settlement. Martin 
Luther King, Jr. was so moved by Nhat Hanh and his proposals for peace 
that he nominated him for the 1967 Nobel Peace Prize, saying, “I know of 
no one more worthy of the Nobel Peace Prize than this gentle monk from 
Vietnam.” Largely due to Thich Nhat Hanh’s influence, King came out 
publicly against the war at a press conference, with Nhat Hanh, in Chicago. 

When Thomas Merton, the well-known Catholic monk and mystic, met 
Thich Nhat Hanh at his monastery, Gethsemani, near Louisville, Kentucky, 
he told his students, “Just the way he opens the door and enters a room 
demonstrates his understanding. He is a true monk.” Merton went on to 
write an essay, “Nhat Hanh Is My Brother,” an impassioned plea to listen to 
Nhat Hanh’s proposals for peace and lend full support for Nhat Hanh’s 
advocacy of peace. After important meetings with Senators Fulbright and 
Kennedy, Secretary of Defense McNamara, and others in Washington, Thich 
Nhat Hanh went to Europe, where he met with a number of heads of state 
and officials of the Catholic church, including two audiences with Pope Paul 
VI, urging cooperation between Catholics and Buddhists to help bring peace 
to Vietnam. 

In 1969, at the request of the Unified Buddhist Church of Vietnam, Thich 
Nhat Hanh set up the Buddhist Peace Delegation to the Paris Peace Talks. 
After the Peace Accords were signed in 1973, he was refused permission to 
return to Vietnam, and he established a small community a hundred miles 
southwest of Paris, called “Sweet Potato.” In 1976-77, Nhat Hanh conducted 
an operation to rescue boat people in the Gulf of Siam, but hostility from the 
governments of Thailand and Singapore made it impossible to continue. So 
for the following five years, he stayed at Sweet Potato in retreat — 
meditating, reading, writing, binding books, gardening, and occasionally 
receiving visitors. 

In June 1982, Thich Nhat Hanh visited New York, and later that year 
established Plum Village, a larger retreat center near Bordeaux, surrounded 
by vineyards and fields of wheat, com, and sunflowers. Since 1983 he has 



traveled to North America every other year to lead retreats and give lectures 
on mindful living and social responsibility, “making peace right in the 
moment we are alive.” 

Although Thich Nhat Hanh cannot visit his homeland handwritten copies 
of his books continue to circulate illegally in Vietnam. His presence is also 
felt through his students and colleagues throughout the world who work full- 
time trying to relieve the suffering of the desperately poor people of 
Vietnam, clandestinely supporting hungry families and campaigning on 
behalf of writers, artists, monks, and nuns who have been imprisoned for 
their beliefs and their art. This work extends to helping refugees threatened 
with repatriation, and sending material and spiritual aid to refugees in the 
camps of Thailand, Malaysia, and Hong Kong. 

Now sixty-four years old, yet looking twenty years younger, Thich Nhat 
Hanh is emerging as one of the great teachers of the twentieth century. In the 
midst of our society’s emphasis on speed, efficiency, and material success, 
Thich Nhat Hanh’ s ability to walk calmly with peace and awareness and to 
teach us to do the same has led to his enthusiastic reception in the West. Al- 
though his mode of expression is simple, his message reveals the 
quintessence of the deep understanding of reality that comes from his 
meditations, his Buddhist training, and his work in the world. 

His way of teaching centers around conscious breathing — the awareness 
of each breath — and, through conscious breathing, mindfulness of each act 
of daily life. Meditation, he tells us, is not just in a meditation hall. It is just 
as sacred to wash the dishes mindfully as to bow deeply or light incense. He 
also tells us that forming a smile on our face can relax hundreds of muscles 
in our body — he calls it “mouth yoga” — and in fact, recent studies have 
shown that when we flex our facial muscles into expressions of joy, we do 
indeed produce the effects on our nervous system that go with real joy. 
Peace and happiness are available, he reminds us, if we can only quiet our 
distracted thinking long enough to come back to the present moment and 
notice the blue sky, the child’s smile, the beautiful sunrise. “If we are 
peaceful, if we are happy, we can smile, and everyone in our family, our 
entire society, will benefit from our peace.” 

Peace Is Every Step is a book of reminders. In the rush of modern life, we 
tend to lose touch with the peace that is available in each moment. Thich 
Nhat Hanh’s creativity lies in his ability to make use of the very situations 
that usually pressure and antagonize us. For him, a ringing telephone is a 
signal to call us back to our true selves. Dirty dishes, red lights, and traffic 
jams are spiritual friends on the path of mindfulness. The most profound 


satisfactions, the deepest feelings of joy and completeness lie as close at 
hand as our next aware breath and the smile we can form right now. 

Peace Is Every Step was assembled from Thich Nhat Hanh’s lectures, 
published and unpublished writings, and informal conversations, by a small 
group of friends — Therese Fitzgerald, Michael Katz, Jane Hirshfield, and 
myself — working closely with Thay Nhat Hanh (pronounced “tie” — the 
Vietnamese word for “teacher”) and with Leslie Meredith, our attentive, 
thorough, and sensitive editor at Bantam. Patricia Curtan provided the 
beautiful dandelion. Special thanks to Marion Tripp, who wrote the 
“Dandelion Poem.” 

This book is the clearest and most complete message yet of a great 
bodhisattva, who has dedicated his life to the enlightenment of others. Thich 
Nhat Hanh’s teaching is simultaneously inspirational and very practical. I 
hope the reader enjoys this book as much as we have enjoyed making it 
available.

PART ONE 
Breathe! You Are Alive 


Twenty-Four Brand-New Hours 

Every morning, when we wake up, we have twenty-four brand-new hours 
to live. What a precious gift! We have the capacity to live in a way that these 
twenty-four hours will bring peace, joy, and happiness to ourselves and 
others. 

Peace is present right here and now, in ourselves and in everything we do 
and see. The question is whether or not we are in touch with it. We don’t 
have to travel far away to enjoy the blue sky. We don’t have to leave our city 
or even our neighborhood to enjoy the eyes of a beautiful child. Even the air 
we breathe can be a source of joy. 

We can smile, breathe, walk, and eat our meals in a way that allows us to 
be in touch with the abundance of happiness that is available. We are very 
good at preparing to live, but not very good at living. We know how to 
sacrifice ten years for a diploma, and we are willing to work very hard to get 
a job, a car, a house, and soon. But we have difficulty remembering that we 
are alive in the present moment, the only moment there is for us to be alive. 


Every breath we take, every step we make, can be filled with peace, joy, and 
serenity. We need only to be awake, alive in the present moment. 

This small book is offered as a bell of mindful ness, a reminder that 
happiness is possible only in the present moment. Of course, planning for 
the future is a part of life. But even planning can only take place in the 
present moment. This book is an invitation to come back to the present 
moment and find peace and joy. I offer some of my experiences and a 
number of techniques that may be of help. But please do not wait until 
finishing this book to find peace. Peace and happiness are available in every 
moment. Peace is every step. We shall walk hand in hand. Bon voyage. 


The Dandelion 
Has My Smile 

If a child smiles, if an adult smiles, that is very important. If in our daily 
lives we can smile, if we can be peaceful and happy, not only we, but 
everyone will profit from it. If we really know how to live, what better way 
to start the day than with a smile? Our smile affirms our awareness and 
determination to live in peace and joy. The source of a true smile is an 
awakened mind. 

How can you remember to smile when you wake up? You might hang a 
reminder — such as a branch, a leaf, a painting, or some inspiring words — in 
your window or from the ceiling above your bed, so that you notice it when 
you wake up. Once you develop the practice of smiling, you may not need a 
reminder. You will smile as soon as you hear a bird singing or see the 
sunlight streaming through the window. Smiling helps you approach the day 
with gentleness and understanding. 

When I see someone smile, I know immediately that he or she is dwelling 
in awareness. This half-smile, how many artists have labored to bring it to 
the lips of countless statues and paintings? I am sure the same smile must 
have been on the faces of the sculptors and painters as they worked. Can you 
imagine an angry painter giving birth to such a smile? Mona Lisa’ s smile is 
light, just a hint of a smile. Yet even a smile like that is enough to relax all 
the muscles in our face, to banish all worries and fatigue. A tiny bud of a 
smile on our lips nourishes awareness and calms us miraculously. It returns 
to us the peace we thought we had lost. 

Our smile will bring happiness to us and to those around us. Even if we 
spend a lot of money on gifts for everyone in our family, nothing we buy 
could give them as much happiness as the gift of our awareness, our smile. 


And this precious gift costs nothing. At the end of a retreat in California, a 
friend wrote this poem: 

I have lost my smile, 
but don ’t worry. 

The dandelion has it. 

If you have lost your smile and yet are still capable of seeing that a 
dandelion is keeping it for you, the situation is not too bad. You still have 
enough mindfulness to see that the smile is there. 

You only need to breathe consciously one or two times and you will 
recover your smile. The dandelion is one member of your community of 
friends. It is there, quite faithful, keeping your smile for you. 

In fact, everything around you is keeping your smile for you. You don’t 
need to feel isolated. You only have to open yourself to the support that is all 
around you, and in you. Like the friend who saw that her smile was being 
kept by the dandelion, you can breathe in awareness, and your smile will 
return. 


Conscious Breathing 

There are a number of breathing techniques you can use to make life vivid 
and more enjoyable. The first exercise is very simple. As you breathe in, you 
say to yourself, “Breathing in, I know that I am breathing in.” And as you 
breathe out, say, “Breathing out, I know that I am breathing out.” Just that. 
You recognize your in-breath as an in-breath and your out-breath as an out- 
breath. You don’t even need to recite the whole sentence; you can use just 
two words: “In” and “Out.” This technique can help you keep your mind on 
your breath. As you practice, your breath will become peaceful and gentle, 
and your mind and body will also become peaceful and gentle. This is not a 
difficult exercise. In just a few minutes you can realize the fruit of 
meditation. 

Breathing in and out is very important, and it is enjoyable. Our breathing 
is the link between our body and our mind. Sometimes our mind is thinking 
of one thing and our body is doing another, and mind and body are not 
unified. By concentrating on our breathing, “In” and “Out,” we bring body 
and mind back together, and become whole again. Conscious breathing is an 
important bridge. 

To me, breathing is a joy that I cannot miss. Every day, I practice 
conscious breathing, and in my small meditation room, I have calligraphed 


this sentence: “Breathe, you are alive!” first breathing and smiling can make 
us very happy, because when we breathe consciously we recover ourselves 
completely and encounter life in the present moment. 


Present Moment Wonderful Moment 

In our busy society, it is a great fortune to breathe consciously from time 
to time. We can practice conscious breathing not only while sitting in a 
meditation room, but also while working at the office or at home, while 
driving our car, or sitting on a bus, wherever we are, at any time throughout 
the day. 

There are so many exercises we can do to help us breathe consciously. 
Besides the simple “In-Out” exercise, we can recite these four lines silently 
as we breathe in and out: 

Breathing in, I calm my body. 

Breathing out, I smile. 

Dwelling in the present moment, 

I know this is a wonderful moment! 

“Breathing in, I calm my body.” Reciting this line is like drinking a glass 
of cool lemonade on a hot day — you can feel the coolness permeate your 
body. When I breathe in and recite this line, I actually feel my breath 
calming my body and mind. 

“Breathing out, I smile.” You know a smile can relax hundreds of muscles 
in your face. Wearing a smile on your face is a sign that you are master of 
yourself. 

“Dwelling in the present moment.” While I sit here, I don’t think of 
anything else. I sit here, and I know exactly where I am. 

“I know this is a wonderful moment.” It is a joy to sit, stable and at ease, 
and return to our breathing, our smiling, our true nature. Our appointment 
with life is in the present moment. If we do not have peace and joy right 
now, when will we have peace and joy — tomorrow, or after tomorrow? 
What is preventing us from being happy right now? As we follow our 
breathing, we can say, simply, “Calming, Smiling, Present moment, 
Wonderful moment.” 

This exercise is not just for beginners. Many of us who have practiced 
meditation and conscious breathing for forty or fifty years continue to 


practice in this same way, because this kind of exercise is so important and 
so easy. 


Thinking Less 


While we practice conscious breathing, our thinking will slow down, and 
we can give ourselves a real rest. Most of the time, we think too much, and 
mindful breathing helps us to be calm, relaxed, and peaceful. It helps us stop 
thinking so much and stop being possessed by sorrows of the past and 
worries about the future. It enables us to be in touch with life, which is 
wonderful in the present moment. 

Of course, thinking is important, but quite a lot of our thinking is useless. 
It is as if, in our head, each of us has a cassette tape that is always running, 
day and night. We think of this and we think of that, and it is difficult to 
stop. With a cassette, we can just press the stop button. But with our 
thinking, we do not have any button. We may think and worry so much that 
we cannot sleep. If we go to the doctor for some sleeping pills or 
tranquilizers, these may make the situation worse, because we do not really 
rest during that kind of sleep, and if we continue using these drugs, we may 
become addicted. We continue to live tensely, and we may have nightmares. 


According to the method of conscious breathing, when we breathe in and 
out, we stop thinking, because saying “In” and “Out” is not thinking — “In” 
and “Out” are only words to help us concentrate on our breathing. If we keep 
breathing in and out this way for a few minutes, we become quite refreshed. 
We recover ourselves, and we can encounter the beautiful things around us 
in the present moment. The past is gone; the future is not yet here. If we do 
not go back to ourselves in the present moment, we cannot be in touch with 
life. 


When we are in touch with the refreshing, peaceful, and healing elements 
within ourselves and around us, we learn how to cherish and protect these 
things and make them grow. These elements of peace are available to us any 
time. 


Nourishing Awareness in Each Moment 

One cold, winter evening I returned home from a walk in the hills, and I 
found that all the doors and windows in my hermitage had blown open. 
When I had left earlier, I hadn’t secured them, and a cold wind had blown 
through the house, opened the windows, and scattered the papers from my 


desk all over the room. Immediately, I closed the doors and windows, lit a 
lamp, picked up the papers, and arranged them neatly on my desk. Then I 
started a fire in the fireplace, and soon the crackling logs brought warmth 
back to the room. 

Sometimes in a crowd we feel tired, cold, and lonely. We may wish to 
withdraw to be by ourselves and become warm again, as I did when I closed 
the windows and sat by the fire, protected from the clamp, cold wind. Our 
senses are our windows to the world, and sometimes the wind blows through 
them and disturbs everything within us. Some of us leave our windows open 
alt the time, allowing the sights and sounds of the world to invade us, 
penetrate us, and expose our sad, troubled selves. We feel so cold, lonely, 
and afraid. Do you ever find yourself watching an awful TV program, 
unable to turn it off? The raucous noises, explosions of gunfire, are 
upsetting. Yet you don’t get up and turn it off. Why do you torture yourself 
in this way? Don’t you want to close your windows? Are you frightened of 
solitude — the emptiness and the loneliness you may find when you face 
yourself alone? 

Watching a bad TV program, we become the TV program. We are what 
we feel and perceive. If we are angry, we are the anger. If we are in love, we 
are love. If we look at a snow-covered mountain peak, we are the mountain. 
We can be anything we want, so why do we open our windows to bad TV 
programs made by sensationalist producers in search of easy money, 
programs that make our hearts pound, our fists tighten, and leave us 
exhausted? Who allows such TV programs to be made and seen by even the 
very young? We do! We are too undemanding, too ready to watch whatever 
is on the screen, too lonely, lazy, or bored to create our own lives. We turn 
on the TV and leave it on, allowing someone else to guide us, shape us, and 
destroy us. Losing ourselves in this way is leaving our fate in the hands of 
others who may not be acting responsibly. We must be aware of which 
programs do harm to our nervous systems, minds, and hearts, and which 
programs benefit us. 

Of course, I am not talking only about television. All around us, how 
many lures are set by our fellows and ourselves? In a single day, how many 
times do we become lost and scattered because of them? We must be very 
careful to protect our fate and our peace. I am not suggesting that we just 
shut all our windows, for there are many miracles in the world we call 
“outside.” We can open our windows to these miracles and look at any one 
of them with awareness. This way, even while sitting beside a clear, flowing 
stream, listening to beautiful music, or watching an excellent movie, we 



need not lose ourselves entirely in the stream, the music, or the film. We can 
continue to be aware of ourselves and our breathing. With the sun of 
awareness shining in us, we can avoid most dangers. The stream will be 
purer, the music more harmonious, and the soul of the filmmaker completely 
visible. 

As beginning mediators, we may want to leave the city and go off to the 
countryside to help close those windows that trouble our spirit. There we can 
become one with the quiet forest, and rediscover and restore ourselves, 
without being swept away by the chaos of the “outside world.” The fresh 
and silent woods help us remain in awareness, and when our awareness is 
well-rooted and we can maintain it without faltering, we may wish to return 
to the city and remain there, less troubled. But sometimes we cannot leave 
the city, and we have to find the refreshing and peaceful elements that can 
heal us right in the midst of our busy lives. We may wish to visit a good 
friend who can comfort us, or go for a walk in a park and enjoy the trees and 
the cool breeze. Whether we are in the city, the countryside, or the 
wilderness, we need to sustain ourselves by choosing our surroundings 
carefully and nourishing our awareness in each moment. 


Sitting Anywhere 

When you need to slow down and come back to yourself, you do not need 
to rush home to your meditation cushion or to a meditation center in order to 
practice conscious breathing. You can breathe anywhere, just sitting on your 
chair at the office or sitting in your automobile. Even if you are at a 
shopping center filled with people or waiting in line at a bank, if you begin 
to feel depleted and need to return to yourself, you can practice conscious 
breathing and smiling just standing there. 

Wherever you are, you can breathe mindfully. We all need to go back to 
ourselves from time to time, in order to be able to confront the difficulties of 
life. We can do this in any position — standing, sitting, lying down, or 
walking. If you can sit down, however, the sitting position is the most stable. 

One time, I was waiting for a plane that was four hours late at Kennedy 
Airport in New York, and I enjoyed sitting cross-legged right in the waiting 
area. I just rolled up my sweater and used it as a cushion, and I sat. People 
looked at me curiously, but after a while they ignored me, and I sat in peace. 
There was no place to rest; the airport was full of people, so I just made 
myself comfortable where I was. You may not want to meditate so 


conspicuously, but breathing mindfully in any position at any time can help 
you recover yourself. 


Sitting Meditation 

The most stable posture for meditation is sitting cross-legged on a 
cushion. Choose a cushion that is the right thickness to support you. The 
half-lotus and full-lotus positions are excellent for establishing stability of 
body and mind. To sit in the lotus position, gently cross your legs by placing 
one foot (for the half-lotus) or both feet (for the full-lotus) on the opposite 
thighs. If the lotus position is difficult, it is fine just to sit cross-legged or in 
any comfortable position. Allow your back to be straight, keep your eyes 
half closed, and fold your hands comfortably on your lap. If you prefer, you 
can sit in a chair with your feet flat on the floor and your hands resting on 
your lap. Or you can lie on the floor, on your back, with your legs straight 
out, a few inches apart, and your arms at your sides, preferably palms up. 

If your legs or feet fall asleep or begin to hurt during sitting meditation so 
that your concentration becomes disturbed, feel free to adjust your position. 
If you do this slowly and attentively, following your breathing and each 
movement of your body, you will not lose a single moment of concentration. 
If the pain is severe, stand up, walk slowly and mindfully, and when you are 
ready, sit down again. 

In some meditation centers, practitioners are not permitted to move during 
periods of sitting meditation. They often have to endure great discomfort. To 
me, this seems unnatural. When a part of our body is number in pain, it is 
telling us something, and we should listen to it. We sit in meditation to help 
us cultivate peace, joy, and nonviolence, not to endure physical strain or to 
injure our bodies. To change the position of our feet or do a little walking 
meditation will not disturb others very much, and it can help us a lot. 

Sometimes, we can use meditation as a way of hiding from ourselves and 
from life, like a rabbit going back to his hole. Doing this, we may be able to 
avoid some problems for a while, but when we leave our “hole,” we will 
have to confront them again. For example, if we practice our meditation very 
intensely, we may feel a kind of relief as we exhaust ourselves and divert our 
energy from confronting our difficulties. But when our energy returns, our 
problems will return with them. 

We need to practice meditation gently, but steadily, throughout daily life, 
not wasting a single opportunity or event to see deeply into the true nature of 


life, including our everyday problems. Practicing in this way, we dwell in 
profound communion with life. 


Bells of Mindfulness 

In my tradition, we use the temple bells to remind us to come back to the 
present moment. Every time we hear the bell, we stop talking, stop our 
thinking, and return to ourselves, breathing in and out, and smiling. 
Whatever we are doing, we pause for a moment and just enjoy our breathing. 
Sometimes we also recite this verse: 

Listen, listen. 

This wonderful sound brings me back to my true self 

When we breathe in, we say, “Listen, listen,” and when we breathe out, 
we say, “This wonderful sound brings me back to my true self.” 

Since I have come to the West, I have not heard many Buddhist temple 
bells. But fortunately, there are church hells all over Europe. There do not 
seem to be as many in the United States; I think that is a pity. Whenever I 
give a lecture in Switzerland, I always make use of the church bells to 
practice mindfulness. When the bell rings, I stop talking, and all of us listen 
to the full sound of the bell. We enjoy it so much. (I think it is better than the 
lecture!) When we hear the bell, we can pause and enjoy our breathing and 
get in touch with the wonders of life that are around us — the flowers, the 
children, the beautiful sounds. Every time we get back in touch with 
ourselves, the conditions become favorable for us to encounter life in the 
present moment. 

One day in Berkeley, I proposed to professors and students at the 
University of California that every time the bell on the campus sounds, the 
professors and students should pause in order to breathe consciously. 
Everyone should take the time to enjoy being alive! We should not just be 
rushing around all day. We have to learn to really enjoy our church bells and 
our school bells. Bells are beautiful, and they can wake us up. 

If you have a bell at home, you can practice breathing and smiling with its 
lovely sound. But you do not have to carry a bell into your office or factory. 
You can use any sound to remind you to pause, breathe in and out, and enjoy 
the present moment. The buzzer that goes off when you forget to fasten the 
seat belt in your car is a belt of mindfulness. Even non-sounds, such as the 
rays of sunlight coming through the window, are hells of mindfulness that 


can remind us to return to ourselves, breathe, smile, and live fully in the 
present moment. 


Cookie of Childhood 

When I was four years old, my mother used to bring me a cookie every 
time she came home from the market. I always went to the front yard and 
took my time eating it; sometimes half an hour or forty-five minutes for one 
cookie. I would take a small bite and look up at the sky. Then I would touch 
the dog with my feet and take another small bite. I just enjoyed being there, 
with the sky, the earth, the bamboo thickets, the cat, the dog, the flowers. I 
was able to do that because I did not have much to worry about. I did not 
think of the future, I did not regret the past. I was entirely in the present 
moment, with my cookie, the dog, the bamboo thickets, the cat, and 
everything. 

It is possible to eat our meals as slowly and joyfully as I ate the cookie of 
my childhood. Maybe you have the impression that you have lost the cookie 
of your childhood, but I am sure it is still there, somewhere in your heart. 
Everything is still there, and if you really want it, you can find it. Eating 
mindfully is a most important practice of meditation. We can eat in a way 
that we restore the cookie of our childhood. The present moment is filled 
with joy and happiness. If you are attentive, you will see it. 


Tangerine Meditation 

If I offer you a freshly picked tangerine to enjoy, I think the degree to 
which you enjoy it will depend on your mindfulness. If you are free of 
worries and anxiety, you will enjoy it more. If you are possessed by anger or 
fear, the tangerine may not be very real to you. 

One day, 1 offered a number of children a basket filled with tangerines. 
The basket was passed around, and each child took one tangerine and put it 
in his or her palm. We each looked at our tangerine, and the children were 
invited to meditate on its origins. They saw not only their tangerine, but also 
its mother, the tangerine tree. With some guidance, they began to visualize 
the blossoms in the sunshine and in the rain. Then they saw petals falling 
down and the tiny green fruit appear. The sunshine and the rain continued, 
and the tiny tangerine grew. Now someone has picked it, and the tangerine is 
here. After seeing this, each child was invited to peel the tangerine slowly, 
noticing the mist and the fragrance of the tangerine, and then bring it up to 


his or her mouth and have a mindful bite, in full awareness of the texture and 
taste of the fruit and the juice coming out. We ate slowly like that. 

Each time you look at a tangerine, you can see deeply into it. You can see 
everything in the universe in one tangerine. When you peel it and smell it, 
it’s wonderful. You can take your time eating a tangerine and he very happy. 


The Eucharist 

The practice of the Eucharist is a practice of awareness. When Jesus broke 
the bread and shared it with his disciples, he said, “Eat this. This is my 
flesh.” He knew that if his disciples would eat one piece of bread in 
mindfulness, they would have real life. In their daily lives, they may have 
eaten their bread in forgetful -ness, so the bread was not bread at all; it was a 
ghost. In our daily lives, we may see the people around us, but if we lack 
mindful-ness, they are just phantoms, not real people, and we ourselves are 
also ghosts. Practicing mindfulness enables us to become a real person. 
When we are a real person, we see real people around us, and life is present 
in all its richness. The practice of eating bread, a tangerine, or a cookie is the 
same. 

When we breathe, when we arc mindful, when we look deeply at our 
food, life becomes real at that very moment. To me, the rite of the Eucharist 
is a wonderful practice of mindfulness. In a drastic way, Jesus tried to wake 
up his disciples. 


Eating Mindfully 

A few years ago, I asked some children, “What is the purpose of eating 
breakfast?” One boy replied, “To get energy for the day.” Another said, 
“The purpose of eating breakfast is to eat breakfast.” I think the second child 
is more correct. The purpose of eating is to eat. 

Eating a meal in mindfulness is an important practice. We turn off the TV, 
put down our newspaper, and work together for five or ten minutes, setting 
the table and finishing whatever needs to be done. During these few minutes, 
we can be very happy. When the food is on the table and everyone is seated, 
we practice breathing: “Breathing in, I calm my body. Breathing out, I 
smile,” three times. We can recover ourselves completely after three breaths 
like this. 

Then, we look at each person as we breathe in and out in order to be in 
touch with ourselves and everyone at the table. We don’t need two hours to 


see another person. If we are really settled within ourselves, we only need to 
look for one or two seconds, and that is enough to see. I think that if a family 
has five members, only about five or ten seconds are needed to practice this 
“looking and seeing.” 

After breathing, we smile. Sitting at the table with other people, we have a 
chance to offer an authentic smile of friendship and understanding. It is very 
easy, but not many people do it. To me, this is the most important practice. 
We look at each person and smile at him or her. Breathing and smiling 
together is a very important practice. If the people in a household cannot 
smile at each other, the situation is very dangerous. 

After breathing and smiling, we look down at the food in a way that 
allows the food to become real. This food reveals our connection with the 
earth. Each bite contains the life of the sun and the earth. The extent to 
which our food reveals itself depends on us. We can see and taste the whole 
universe in a piece of bread! Contemplating our food for a few seconds 
before eating, and eating in mindfulness, can bring us much happiness. 

Having the opportunity to sit with our family and friends and enjoy 
wonderful food is something precious, something not everyone has. Many 
people in the world are hungry. When I hold a bowl of rice or a piece of 
bread, I know that I am fortunate, and I feel compassion for all those who 
have no food to eat and are without friends or family. This is a very deep 
practice. We do not need to go to a temple or a church in order to practice 
this. We can practice it right at our dinner table. Mindful eating can cultivate 
seeds of compassion and understanding that will strengthen us to do 
something to help hungry and lonely people be nourished. 

In order to aid mindfulness during meals, you may like to eat silently from 
time to time. Your first silent meal may cause you to feel a little 
uncomfortable, but once you become used to it, you will realize that meals in 
silence bring much peace and happiness. Just as we turn off the TV before 
eating, we can “turn off’ the talking in order to enjoy the food and the 
presence of one another. 

I do not recommend silent meals every day. Talking to each other can be a 
wonderful way to be together in mindfulness. But we have to distinguish 
among different kinds of talk. Some subjects can separate us: for instance, if 
we talk about other people’s shortcomings. The carefully prepared food will 
have no value if we let this kind of talk dominate our meal. When instead we 
speak about things that nourish our awareness of the food and our being 
together, we cultivate the kind of happiness that is necessary for us to grow. 



If we compare this experience with the experience of talking about other 
people’s shortcomings, we will realize that the awareness of the piece of 
bread in our mouth is much more nourishing. It brings life in and makes life 
real. 

So, while eating, we should refrain from discussing subjects that can 
destroy our awareness of our family and the food. But we should feel free to 
say things that can nourish awareness and happiness. For instance, if there is 
a dish that you like very much, you can notice if other people are also 
enjoying it, and if one of them is not, you can help him or her appreciate the 
wonderful dish prepared with loving care. If someone is thinking about 
something other than the good food on the table, such as his difficulties in 
the office or with friends, he is losing the present moment and the food. You 
can say, “This dish is wonderful, don’t you agree?” to draw him out of his 
thinking and worries and bring him back Co the here and now, enjoying you, 
enjoying the wonderful dish. You become bodhisattvu, helping a living 
being become enlightened. Children, in particular, are very capable of 
practicing mindfulness and reminding others to do the same. 


Washing Dishes 

To my mind, the idea that doing dishes is unpleasant can occur only when 
you aren’t doing them. Once you are standing in front of the sink with your 
sleeves rolled up and your hands in the warm water, it is really quite 
pleasant. I enjoy taking my time with each dish, being fully aware of the 
dish, the water, and each movement of my hands. I know that if I hurry in 
order to eat dessert sooner, the time of washing dishes will be unpleasant 
and not worth living. That would be a pity, for each minute, each second of 
life is a miracle. The dishes themselves and the fact that I am here washing 
them are miracles! 

If I am incapable of washing dishes joyfully, if I want to finish them 
quickly so I can go and have dessert, I will be equally incapable of enjoying 
my dessert. With the fork in my hand, I will be thinking about what to do 
next, and the texture and the flavor of the dessert, together with the pleasure 
of eating it, will be lost. I will always be dragged into the future, never able 
to live in the present moment. 

Each thought, each action in the sunlight of awareness becomes sacred. In 
this light, no boundary exists between the sacred and the profane. I must 
confess it takes me a bit longer to do the dishes, but I live fully in every 
moment, and I am happy. Washing the dishes is at the same time a means 


and an end — that is, not only do we do the dishes in order to have clean 
dishes; we also do the dishes just to do the dishes, to live fully in each mo- 
ment while washing them. 


Walking Meditation 

Walking meditation can be very enjoyable. We walk slowly, alone or with 
friends, if possible in some beautiful place. Walking meditation is really to 
enjoy the walking — walking not in order to arrive, but just to walk. The 
purpose is to be in the present moment and, aware of our breathing and our 
walking, to enjoy each step. Therefore we have to shake off all worries and 
anxieties, not thinking of the future, not thinking of the past, just enjoying 
the present moment. We can take the hand of a child as we do it. We walk; 
we make steps as if we are the happiest person on Earth. 

Although we walk all the time, our walking is usually more like running. 
When we walk like that, we print anxiety and sorrow on the Earth. We have 
to walk in a way that we only print peace and serenity on the Earth. We can 
all do this, provided that we want it very much. Any child can do it. If we 
can take one step like this, we can take two, three, four, and five. When we 
are able to take one step peacefully and happily, we are working for the 
cause of peace and happiness for the whole of humankind. Walking 
meditation is a wonderful practice. 

When we do walking meditation outside, we walk a little slower than our 
normal pace, and we coordinate our breathing with our steps. For example, 
we may take three steps with each in-breath and three steps with each out- 
breath. So we can say, “In, in, in. Out, out, out.” “In” is to help us to identify 
the in-breath. Every time we call something by its name, we make it more 
real, like saying the name of a friend. 

If your lungs want tour steps instead of three, please give them four steps. 
If they want only two steps, give them two. The lengths of your in-breath 
and out-breath do not have to be the same. For example, you can take three 
steps with each inhalation and four with each exhalation. If you feel happy, 
peaceful, and joyful while you arc walking, you are practicing correctly. 

Be aware of the contact between your feet and the Earth. Walk as if you 
are kissing the Earth with your feet. We have caused a lot of damage to the 
Earth. Now it is time for us to take good care of her. We bring our peace and 
calm to the surface of the Earth and share the lesson of love. We walk in that 
spirit. From time to time, when we see something beautiful, we may want to 
stop and look at it — a tree, a flower, some children playing. As we look, we 


continue to follow our breathing, lest we lose the beautiful flower and get 
caught up in our thoughts. When we want to resume walking, we just start 
again. Each step we take will create a cool breeze, refreshing our body and 
mind. Every step makes a flower bloom under our feet. We can do it only if 
we do not think of the future or the past, if we know that life can only be 
found in the present moment. 


Telephone Meditation 

The telephone is very convenient, but we can be tyrannized by-it. We may 
find its ring disturbing or feel interrupted by too many calls. When we talk 
on the phone, we may forget that we are talking on the telephone, wasting 
precious time (and money). Often we talk about things that are not that 
important. How many times have we received our phone bill and winced at 
the amount of it? The telephone bell creates in us a kind of vibration, and 
maybe some anxiety: “Who is calling? Is it good news or bad news?” Yet 
some force in us pulls us to the phone, and we cannot resist. We are victims 
or our own telephone. 

I recommend that the next time you hear the phone ring, just stay where 
you are, breathe in and out consciously, smile to yourself, and recite this 
verse: “Listen, listen. This wonderful sound brings me back to my true self.” 
When the bell rings for the second time, you can repeat the verse, and your 
smile will be even more solid. When you smile, the muscles of your face 
relax, and your tension quickly vanishes. You can afford to practice breath- 
ing and smiling like this, because if the person calling has something 
important to say, she will certainly wait for at least three rings. When the 
phone rings for the third time, you can continue to practice breathing and 
smiling, as you walk to the phone slowly, with all your sovereignty. You are 
your own master. You know that you are smiling not only for your own 
sake, but also for the sake of the other person. If you are irritated or angry, 
the other person will receive your negativity. But because you have been 
breathing consciously and smiling, you are dwelling in mindfulness, and 
when you pick up the phone, how fortunate for the person calling you! 

Before making a phone call, you can also breathe in and out three times, 
then dial. When you hear the other phone ring, you know that your friend is 
practicing breathing and smiling and will not pick it up until the third ring. 
So you tell yourself, “She is breathing, why not me?” You practice breathing 
in and out, and she does too. That’s very beautiful! 


You don’t have to go into a meditation hall to do this wonderful practice 
of meditation. You can do it in your office and at home. I don’t know how 
phone operators can practice while so many phones ring simultaneously. I 
rely on you to find a way for operators to practice telephone meditation. But 
those of us who are not operators have the right to three breaths. Practicing 
telephone meditation can counteract stress and depression and bring 
mindfulness into our daily lives. 


Driving Meditation 

In Vietnam, forty years ago, I was the first monk to ride a bicycle. At that 
time, it was not considered a very “monkish” thing to do. But today, monks 
ride motorcycles and drive cars. We have lo keep our meditation practices 
up to date and respond to the real situation in the world, so I have written a 
simple verse you can recite before starting your car. I hope you find it 
helpful: 

Before starting the car, 

I know where I am going. 

The car and I are one. 

If the car goes fast, I go fast. 

Sometimes we don’t really need to use the car, but because we want to get 
away from ourselves, we go for a drive. We feel that there is a vacuum in us 
and we don’t want to confront it. We don’t like being so busy, but every 
time we have a spare moment, we are afraid of being alone with ourselves. 
We want to escape. Either we turn on the television, pick up the telephone, 
read a novel, go out with a friend, or take the car and go somewhere. Our 
civilization teaches us to act this way and provides us with many things we 
can use to lose touch with ourselves. If we recite this poem as we are about 
to turn the ignition key of our car, it can be like a torch, and we may see that 
we don’t need to go anywhere. Wherever we go, our “self’ will be with us; 
we cannot escape. So it may be better, and more pleasant, to leave the engine 
off and go out for a walking meditation. 

It is said that in the last several years, two million square miles of forest 
land have been destroyed by acid rain, partly because of our cars. “Before 
starting the car, I know where I am going,” is a very deep question. Where 
shall we go? To our own destruction? If the trees die, we humans are going 
to die also. If die journey you are making is necessary, please do not hesitate 
to go. But it” you see that it is not really important; you can remove the key 


from the ignition and go instead for a walk along the riverbank or through a 
park. You will return to yourself and make friends with the trees again. 

“The car and I are one.” We have the impression that we are the boss, and 
the car is only an instrument, but that is not true. When we use any 
instrument or machine, we change. A violinist with his violin becomes very 
beautiful. A man with a gun becomes very dangerous. When we use a car, 
we are ourselves and the car. 

Driving is a daily task in this society. I am not suggesting you stop 
driving, just that you do so consciously. While we are driving, we think only 
about arriving. Therefore, every time we see a red light, we are not very 
happy. The red light is a kind of enemy that prevents us from attaining our 
goal. But we can also seethe red light as a bell of mindfulness, reminding us 
to return to the present moment. The next time you see a red light, please 
smile at it and go back to your breathing. “Breathing in I calm my body. 
Breathing out, I smile.” It is easy to transform a feeling of irritation into a 
pleasant feeling. Although it is the same red light, it becomes different. It 
becomes a friend, helping us remember that it is only in the present moment 
that we can live ourlives. 

When I was in Montreal several years ago to lead a retreat, a friend drove 
me across the city to go to the mountains. I noticed that every time a car 
stopped in front of me, the sentence Je me souviens” was on the license 
plate. It means “I remember. I was not sure what they wanted to remember, 
perhaps their French origins, but I told my friend that I had a gift for him. 
“Every time you see a car with that sentence, ‘Je me souviens ’ remember to 
breathe and smile. It is a bell of mindfulness. You will have many 
opportunities to breathe and smile as you drive through Montreal.” 

He was delighted, and he shared the practice with his friends. Later, when 
he visited me in France, he told me that it was more difficult to practice in 
Paris than in Montreal, because in Paris there is no “Je me souviens. ” I told 
him, “There are red light stop signs everywhere in Paris. Why don’t you 
practice with them?” After he went back to Montreal, through Paris, he 
wrote me a very nice letter: “Thay, it was very easy to practice in Paris. 
Every time a car stopped in front of me, I saw the eyes of the Buddha 
blinking at me. I had to answer him by breathing and smiling, there was no 
better answer than that. I had a wonderful time driving in Paris.” 

The next time you are caught in a traffic jam, don’t fight. It’s useless to 
fight. Sit back and smile to yourself, a smile of compassion and loving 
kindness. Enjoy the present moment, breathing and smiling, and make the 



other people in your car happy. Happiness is there if you know how to 
breathe and smile, because happiness can always be found in the present 
moment. Practicing meditation is to go back to the present moment in order 
to encounter the flower, the blue sky, the child. Happiness is available. 


De-compartmentalization 

We have so many compartments in our lives. How can we bring 
meditation out of the meditation hall and into the kitchen, and the officer in 
the meditation hall we sit quietly, and try to be aware of each breath. How 
can our sitting influence our non-sitting time? When a doctor gives you an 
injection, not only your arm hut your whole body benefits from it. When you 
practice half an hour of sitting meditation a day, that time should be for all 
twenty-four hours, and not just for that half-hour. One smile, one breath, 
should be for the benefit of the whole day, not just for that moment. We 
must practice in a way that removes the barrier between practice and non- 
practice. 

When we walk in the meditation hall, we make careful steps, very slowly. 
But when we go to the airport or the supermarket, we become quite another 
person. We walk very quickly, less mindfully. How can we practice 
mindfulness at the airport and in the supermarket? I have a friend who 
breathes between telephone calls, and it helps her very much. Another friend 
does walking meditation between business appointments, walking mindfully 
between buildings in downtown Denver. Passersby smile at him, and his 
meetings, even with difficult persons, often turn out to be quite pleasant, and 
very successful. 

We should be able to bring the practice from the meditation hall into our 
daily lives. We need to discuss among ourselves how to do it. Do you 
practice breathing between phone calls? Do you practice smiling while 
cutting carrots? Do you practice relaxation after hours of hard work r These 
are practical questions. If you know how to apply meditation to dinner time, 
leisure time, sleeping time, it will penetrate your daily life, and it will also 
have a tremendous effect on social concerns. Mindfulness can penetrate the 
activities of everyday life, each minute, each hour of our daily life, and not 
just be a description of something far away. 


Breathing and Scything 

Have you ever cut grass with a scythe? Not many people do these days. 
About ten years ago, I brought a scythe home and tried to cut the grass 


around my cottage with it. It took more than a week before I fount] the best 
way to use it. The way you stand, the way you hold the scythe, the angle of 
the blade on the grass are all important. I found that if I coordinated the 
movement of my arms with the rhythm of my breathing, and worked 
unhurriedly while maintaining awareness of my activity, I was able to work 
for a longer period of time. When I didn’t do this, I became tired in just ten 
minutes. 

During the past few years I have avoided tiring myself and losing my 
breath. I must take care of my body; treat it with respect as a musician does 
his instrument. I apply nonviolence to my body, for it is not merely a tool to 
accomplish something. It itself is the end. I treat my scythe in the same way. 
As I use it while following my breathing, I feel that my scythe and I breathe 
together in rhythm. It is true for many other tools as well. 

One day an elderly man was visiting my neighbor, and he offered to show 
me how to use the scythe. He was much more adept than I, but for the most 
part he used the same position and movements. What surprised me was that 
he too coordinated his movements with his breathing. Since then, whenever I 
see anyone cutting his grass with a scythe, I know he is practicing 
awareness. 


Aimlessness 

In the West, we are very goal oriented. We know where we want to go, 
and we are very directed in getting there. This may be useful, but often we 
forget to enjoy ourselves along the route. 

There is a word in Buddhism that means “wishlessness” or “aimlessness.” 
The idea is that you do not put something in front of you and run after it, 
because everything is already here, in yourself. While we practice walking 
meditation, we do not try to arrive anywhere. We only make peaceful, happy 
steps. If we keep thinking of the future, of what we want to realize, we will 
lose our steps. The same is true with sitting meditation. We sit just to enjoy 
our sitting; we do not sit in order to attain any goal. This is quite important. 
Each moment of sitting meditation brings us back to life, and we should sit 
in a way that we enjoy our sitting for the entire time we do it. Whether we 
are eating a tangerine, drinking a cup of tea, or walking in meditation, we 
should do it in a way that is “aimless.” 

Often we tell ourselves, “Don’t just sit there, do something!” But when 
we practice awareness, we discover something unusual. We discover that the 
opposite may be more helpful: “Don’t just do something, sit there!” We 


must learn to stop from time to time in order to see clearly. At first, 
“stopping” may look like a kind of resistance to modern life, but it is not. h 
is not just a reaction; it is a way of life. Humankind’s survival depends on 
our ability to stop rushing. We have more than 50,000 nuclear bombs, and 
yet we cannot stop making more. “Stopping” is not only to stop the negative, 
but to allow positive healing to take place. That is the purpose of our 
practice — not to avoid life, but to experience and demonstrate that happiness 
in life is possible now and also in the future. 

The foundation of happiness is mindfulness. The basic condition for being 
happy is our consciousness of being happy. If we are not aware that we are 
happy, we are not really happy. When we have a toothache, we know that 
not having a toothache is a wonderful thing. But when we do not have a 
toothache, we are still not happy. A non-toothache is very pleasant. There 
are so many things that are enjoyable, but when we don’t practice 
mindfulness, we don’t appreciate them. When we practice mindfulness, we 
come to cherish these things and we learn how to protect them. By taking 
good care of the present moment, we take good care of the future. Working 
for peace in the future is to work for peace in the present moment. 


Our Life Is a Work of Art 

After a retreat in southern California, an artist asked me, “What is the way 
to look at a flower so that I can make the most of it for my art?” I said, “If 
you look in that way, you cannot be in touch with the flower. Abandon all 
your projects so you can be with the flower with no intention of exploiting it 
or getting something from it.” The same artist told me, “When I am with a 
friend, I want to profit from him or her.” Of course we can profit from a 
friend, hut a friend is more than a source of profit. Just to be with a friend, 
without thinking to ask for his or her support, help, or advice, is an art. 

It has become a kind of habit to look at things with the intention of getting 
something. We call ii “pragmatism,” and we say that the truth is something 
that pays. If we meditate in order to get to the truth, it seems we will be well 
paid. In meditation, we stop, and we look deeply. We stop just to be there, to 
be with ourselves and with the world. When we are capable of stopping, we 
begin to see and, if we can see, we understand. Peace and happiness are the 
fruit of this process. We should master the art of stopping in order to really 
be with our friend and with the flower. 

How can we bring elements of peace to a society that is very used to 
making profit? How can our smile be the source of joy and not just a 


diplomatic maneuver? When we smile to ourselves, that smile is not 
diplomacy; it is the proof that we are ourselves, that we have full 
sovereignty over ourselves. Can we write a poem on stopping, aimlessness, 
or just being? Can we paint something about it? Everything we do is an act 
of poetry or a painting if we do it with mindfulness. Growing lettuce is 
poetry. Walking to the supermarket can be a painting. 

When we do not trouble ourselves about whether or not something is a 
work of art, if we just act in each moment with composure and mindfulness, 
each minute of our life is a work of art. Even when we are not painting or 
writing, we are still creating. We are pregnant with beauty, joy, and peace, 
and we are making life more beautiful for many people. Sometimes it is 
better not to talk about art by using the word “art.” If we just act with 
awareness and integrity, our art will flower, and we don’t have to talk about 
it at all. When we know how to be peace, we find that art is a wonderful way 
to share our peacefulness. Artistic expression will take place in one way or 
another, but the being is essential. So we must go back to ourselves, and 
when we have joy and peace in ourselves, our creations of art will be quite 
natural, and they will serve the world in a positive way. 


Hope as an Obstacle 

Hope is important, because it can make the present moment less difficult 
to bear. If we believe that tomorrow will be better, we can bear a hardship 
today. But that is the most that hope can do for us — to make some hardship 
lighter. When I think deeply about the nature of hope, I see something tragic. 
Since we cling to our hope in the future, we do not focus our energies and 
capabilities on the present moment. We use hope to believe something better 
will happen in the future, that we will arrive at peace, or the Kingdom of 
God. Hope becomes a kind of obstacle. If you can refrain from hoping, you 
can bring yourself entirely into the present moment and discover the joy that 
is already here. 

Enlightenment, peace, and joy will not be granted by someone else. The 
well is within us, and if we dig deeply in the present moment, the water will 
spring forth. We must go back to the present moment in order to be really 
alive. When we practice conscious breathing, we practice going back to the 
present moment where everything is happening. 

Western civilization places so much emphasis on the idea of hope that we 
sacrifice the present moment. Hope is for the future. It cannot help us 
discover joy, peace, or enlightenment in the present moment. Many religions 


are based on the notion of hope, and this teaching about refraining from 
hope may create a strong reaction. But the shock can bring about something 
important. I do not mean that you should not have hope, but that hope is not 
enough. Hope can create an obstacle for you, and if you dwell in the energy 
of hope, you will not bring yourself hack entirely into the present moment. If 
you re-channel those energies into being aware of what is going on in the 
present moment, you will be able to make a breakthrough and discover joy 
and peace right in the present moment, inside of yourself and all around you. 

A. J. Muste, the mid- twentieth-century leader of the peace movement in 
America who inspired millions of people, said, “There is no way to peace, 
peace is the way.” This means that we can realize peace right in the present 
moment with our look, our smile, our words, and our actions. Peace work is 
not a means. Each step we make should be peace. Each step we make should 
be joy. Each step we make should be happiness. If we are determined, we 
can do it. We don’t need the future. We can smile and relax. Everything we 
want is right here in the present moment. 


Flower Insights 

There is a story about a flower which is well known in the Zen circles. 
One day the Buddha held up a flower in front of an audience of 1,250 monks 
and nuns. He did not say anything for quite a long time. The audience was 
perfectly silent. Everyone seemed to be thinking hard, trying to see the 
meaning behind the Buddha’s gesture. Then, suddenly, the Buddha smiled. 
He smiled because someone in the audience smiled at him and at the flower. 
The name of that monk was Mahakashyapa. He was the only person who 
smiled, and the Buddha smiled hack and said, “I have a treasure of insight, 
and I have transmitted it to Mahakashyapa.” That story has been discussed 
by many generations of Zen students, and people continue to look for its 
meaning. To me the meaning is quite simple. When someone holds up a 
flower and shows it to you, he wants you to see it. If you keep thinking, you 
miss the flower. The person who was not thinking, who was just himself, 
was able to encounter the flower in depth, and he smiled. 

That is the problem of life. If we are not fully ourselves, truly in the 
present moment, we miss everything. When a child presents himself to you 
with his smile, if you are not really there — thinking about the future or the 
past, or preoccupied with other problems — then the child is not really there 
for you. The technique of being alive is to go back to yourself in order for 


the child to appear like a marvelous reality. Then you can see him smile and 
you can embrace him in your arms. 

I would like to share a poem with you, written by a friend of mine who 
died at the age of twenty-eight in Saigon, about thirty years ago. After he 
died, people found many beautiful poems he had written, and I was startled 
when I read this poem. It has just a few short lines, but it is very beautiful: 


Standing quietly by the fence, 
you smile your wondrous smile. 

Iam speechless, and my senses are filled 
by the sounds of your beautiful song, 
beginningless and endless. 

I bow deeply to you. 

“You” refers to a flower, a dahlia. That morning as he passed by a fence, 
he saw that little flower very deeply and, struck by the sight of it; he stopped 
and wrote that poem. 

I enjoy this poem very much. You might think that the poet was a mystic, 
because his way of looking and seeing things is very deep. But he was just 
an ordinary person like any one of us. I don’t know how or why he was able 
to look and see like that, but it is exactly the way we practice mindfulness. 
We try to be in touch with life and look deeply as we drink our tea, walk, sit 
down, or arrange flowers. The secret of the success is that you are really 
yourself, and when you are really yourself, you can encounter life in the 
present moment. 


Breathing Room 

We have a room for everything — eating, sleeping, watching TV — hut we 
have no room for mindfulness. I recommend that we set up a small room in 
our homes and call it a “breathing room,” where we can be alone and 
practice just breathing and smiling, at least in difficult moments. That little 
room should be regarded as an Embassy of the Kingdom of Peace. It should 
he respected, and not violated by anger, shouting, or things like chat. When a 
child is about to be shouted at, she can take refuge in that room. Neither the 
father nor the mother can shout at her anymore. She is safe within the 
grounds of the Embassy. Parents sometimes will need to take refuge in that 


room, also, to sit down, breathe, smile, and restore themselves. Therefore, 
that room is for the benefit of the whole family. 

I suggest that the breathing room be decorated very simply, and not be too 
bright. You may want to have a small bell, one with a beautiful sound, a few 
cushions or chairs, and perhaps a vase of flowers to remind us of our true 
nature. You or your children can arrange flowers in mindfulness, smiling. 
Every time you feel a little upset, you know that the best thing to do is to go 
to that room, open the door slowly, sit down, invite the bell to sound — in my 
country we don’t say “strike” or “hit” a hell — and begin to breathe. The bell 
will help not only the person in the breathing room, but the others in the 
house as well. 

Suppose your husband is irritated. Since he has learned the practice of 
breathing, he knows that the best thing is to go into that room, sit down, and 
practice. You may not realize where he has gone; you were busy cutting 
carrots in the kitchen. But you suffer also, because you and he just had some 
kind of altercation. You are cutting the carrots a hit strongly, because the 
energy of the anger is translated into the movement. Suddenly, you hear the 
bell, and you know what to do. You stop cutting and you breathe in and out. 
You feel better, and you may smile, thinking about your husband, who 
knows what to do when he gets angry. He is now sitting in the breathing 
room, breathing and smiling. That’s wonderful; not many people do that. 
Suddenly, a feeling of tenderness arises, and you feel much better. After 
three breaths, you begin to cut the carrots again, but this time, quite 
differently. 

Your child, who was witnessing the scene, knew that a kind of tern pest 
was going to break-She withdrew to her room, closed the door, and silently 
waited. But instead of a storm, she heard the bell, and she understood what 
was going on. She feels so relieved, and she wants to show her appreciation 
to her father. She goes slowly to the breathing room, opens the door, and 
quietly enters and sits down beside him to show her support. That helps him 
very much. He already felt ready to go out — he is able to smile now — but 
since his daughter is sitting there, he wants to sound the bell again for his 
daughter to breathe. 

In the kitchen, you hear the second bell and you know that cutting carrots 
may not be the best thing to do now. So, you put down your knife and go 
into the breathing room. Your husband is aware that the door is opening and 
you are coming in. So, although he is now all right, since you are coming, he 
stays on for some time longer and sounds the bell for you to breathe. This is 
a beautiful scene. If you are very wealthy, you can buy a precious painting 



by van Gogh and hang it m your living room. But it will be less beautiful 
than this scene in the breathing room. The practice of peace and 
reconciliation is one of the most vital and artistic of human actions. 

I know of families where children go into a breathing room after 
breakfast, sit down, and breathe, “in-out-one,” “in-out-two,” “in-out-three,” 
and so on up to ten, and then they go to school. If your child doesn’t wish to 
breathe ten times, perhaps three times is enough. Beginning the day this way 
is very beautiful and very helpful to the whole family. If you arc mindful in 
the morning and try to nourish mindfulness throughout the day, you may be 
able to come home at the end of a day with a smile, which proves that 
mindfulness is still there. 

I believe that every home should have one room for breathing. Simple 
practices like conscious breathing and smiling are very important. They can 
change our civilization. 


Continuing the Journey 

We have walked together in mindfulness, learning how to breathe and 
smile in full awareness, at home, at work, and throughout the day. We have 
discussed eating mindfully, washing the dishes, driving, answering the 
telephone, and even cutting the grass with a scythe. Mindfulness is the 
foundation of a happy life. 

But how can we deal with difficult emotions? What should we do when 
we feel anger, hatred, remorse, or sadness? There are many practices I have 
learned and a number I have discovered during the past forty years for 
working with these kinds of mental states. Shall we continue our journey 
together and try some of these practices? 

PART TWO 

Transformation and Healing 


The River of Feelings 

Our feelings play a very important part in directing all of our thoughts and 
actions. In us, there is a river of feelings, in which every drop of water is a 
different feeling, and each feeling relies on all the others for its existence. To 
observe it, we just sit on the bank of the river and identify each feeling as it 
surfaces, flows by, and disappears. 


There are three sorts of feelings — pleasant, unpleasant, and neutral. When 
we have an unpleasant feeling, we may want to chase it away. But it is more 
effective to return to our conscious breathing and just observe it, identifying 
it silently to ourselves: “Breathing in, I know there is an unpleasant feeling 
in me. Breathing out, I know there is an unpleasant feeling in me.” Calling a 
feeling by its name, such as “anger,” “sorrow,” “joy,” or “happiness,” helps 
us identify it clearly and recognize it more deeply. 


We can use our breathing to be in contact with our feelings and accept 
them. If our breathing is light and calm — a natural result of conscious 
breathing — our mind and body will slowly become light, calm, and clear, 
and our feelings also. Mindful observation is based on the principle of “non- 
duality”: our feeling is not separate from us or caused merely by something 
outside us; our feeling is us, and for the moment we are that feeling. We are 
neither drowned in nor terrorized by the feeling, nor do we reject it. Our 
attitude of not clinging to or rejecting our feelings is the attitude of letting 
go, an important part of meditation practice. 


If we face our unpleasant feelings with care, affection, and nonviolence, 
we can transform them into the kind of energy that is healthy and has the 
capacity to nourish us. By the work of mindful observation, our unpleasant 
feelings can illuminate so much for us, offering us insight and understanding 
into ourselves and society. 


Non-Surgery 

Western medicine emphasizes surgery too much. Doctors want to take out 
the things that are not wanted. When we have something irregular in our 
body, too often they advise us to have an operation. The same seems to be 
true in psychotherapy. Therapists want to help us throw out what is 
unwanted and keep only what is wanted. But what is left may not be very 
much. If we try to throw away what we don’t want, we may throw away 
most of ourselves. 

Instead of acting as if we can dispose of parts of ourselves, we should 
learn the art of transformation. We can transform our anger, for example, 
into something more wholesome. Like understanding. We do not need 
surgery to remove our anger. If we become angry at our anger, we will have 
two angers at the same time. We only have to observe it with love and 
attention. If we take care of our anger in this way, without trying to run away 
from it, it will transform itself. This is peacemaking. If we are peaceful in 


ourselves, we can make peace with our anger. We can deal with depression, 
anxiety, fear, or any unpleasant feeling in the same way. 


Transforming Feelings 

The first step in dealing with feelings is to recognize each feeling as it 
arises. The agent that does this is mindfulness. In the case of fear, for 
example, you bring out your mindfulness, look at your fear, and recognize it 
as fear. You know that fear springs from yourself and that mindfulness also 
springs from yourself. They are both in you, not fighting, but one taking care 
of the other. 

The second step is to become one with the feeling. It is best not to say, 
“Go away, Fear. I don’t like you. You are not me.” It is much more effective 
to say, “Hello, Fear. How are you today?” Then you can invite the two 
aspects of yourself, mindfulness and fear, to shake hands as friends and 
become one. Doing this may seem frightening, but because you know that 
you are more than just your fear, you need not be afraid. As long as 
mindfulness is there, it can chaperone your fear. The fundamental practice is 
to nourish your mindfulness with conscious breathing, to keep it there, alive 
and strong. Although your mindfulness may not be very powerful in the 
beginning, if you nourish it, it will become stronger. As long as mindfulness 
is present, you will not drown in your fear. In fact, you begin transforming it 
the very moment you give birth to awareness in yourself. 

The third step is to calm the feeling. As mindfulness is taking good care 
of your fear, you begin to calm it down. “Breathing in, I calm the activities 
of body and mind.” You calm your feeling just by being with it, like a 
mother tenderly holding her crying baby. Feeling his mother’s tenderness, 
the baby will calm down and stop crying. The mother is your mindfulness, 
born from the depth of your consciousness, and it will tend the feeling of 
pain. A mother holding her baby is one with her baby. If the mother is 
thinking of other things, the baby will not calm down. The mother has to put 
aside other things and just hold her baby. So, don’t avoid your feeling. Don’t 
say, “You are not important. You are only a feeling.” Come and be one with 
it. You can say, “Breathing out, I calm my fear.” 

The fourth step is to release the feeling, to let it go. Because of your calm, 
you feel at ease, even in the midst of fear, and you know that your fear will 
not grow into something that will overwhelm you. When you know that you 
are capable of taking care of your fear, it is already reduced to the minimum, 
becoming softer and not so unpleasant. Now you can smile at it and let it go, 


but please do not stop yet. Calming and releasing are just medicines for the 
symptoms. You now have an opportunity to go deeper and work on 
transforming the source of your fear. 

The fifth step is to look deeply. You look deeply into your baby — your 
feeling of fear — to see what is wrong, even after the baby has already 
stopped crying, after the fear is gone. You cannot hold your baby all the 
time, and therefore you have to look into him to sec the cause of what is 
wrong. By looking, you will see what will help you begin to transform the 
feeling. You will realize, for example, that his suffering has many causes, 
inside and outside of his body. If something is wrong around him, if you put 
that in order, bringing tenderness and care to the situation, he will feel better. 
Looking into your baby, you see the elements that are causing him to cry, 
and when you see them, you will know what to do and what not to do to 
transform the feeling and be free. 

This is a process similar to psychotherapy. Together with the patient, a 
therapist looks at the nature of the pain. Often, the therapist can uncover 
causes of suffering that stem from the way the patient looks at things, the 
beliefs he holds about himself, his culture, and the world. The therapist 
examines these viewpoints and beliefs with the patient, and together they 
help free him from the kind of prison he has been in. But the patient’s efforts 
are crucial. A teacher has to give birth to the teacher within his student, and 
a psychotherapist has to give birth to the psychotherapist within his patient. 
The patient’s “internal psychotherapist” can then work full-time in a very 
effective way. 

The therapist does not treat the patient by simply giving him another set 
of beliefs. She tries to help him see which kinds of ideas and beliefs have led 
to his suffering. Many patients want to get rid of their painful feelings, but 
they do not want to get rid of their beliefs, the viewpoints that are the very 
roots of their feelings. So therapist and patient have to work together to help 
the patient see things as they are. The same is true when we use mindfulness 
to transform our feelings. After recognizing the feeling, becoming one with 
it, calming it down, and releasing it, we can look deeply into its causes, 
which are often based on inaccurate perceptions. As soon as we understand 
the causes and nature of our feelings, they begin to transform themselves. 


Mindfulness of Anger 

Anger is an unpleasant feeling. It is like a blazing flame that burns up our 
self-control and causes us to say and do things that we regret later. When 


someone is angry, we can see clearly that he or she is abiding in hell. Anger 
and hatred are the materials from which hell is made. A mind without anger 
is cool, fresh, and sane. The absence of anger is the basis of real happiness, 
the basis of love and compassion. 

When our anger is placed under the lamp of mindfulness, it immediately 
begins to lose some of its destructive nature. We can say to ourselves, 
“Breathing in, I know that anger is in me. Breathing out, I know that I am 
my anger.” If we follow our breathing closely while we identify and 
mindfully observe our anger, it can no longer monopolize our consciousness. 

Awareness can be called upon to be a companion for our anger. Our 
awareness of our anger does not suppress it or drive it out. It just looks after 
it. This is a very important principle. Mindfulness is not a judge. It is more 
like an older sister looking after and comforting her younger sister in an 
affectionate and caring way. We can concentrate on our breathing in order to 
maintain this mindfulness and know ourselves fully. 

When we are angry, we are not usually inclined to return to ourselves. We 
want to think about the person who is making us angry, to think about his 
hateful aspects — his rudeness, dishonesty, cruelty, maliciousness, and so on. 
The more we think about him, listen to him, or look at him, the more our 
anger flares. His dishonesty and hatefulness may be real, imaginary, or 
exaggerated, but, in fact, the root of the problem is the anger itself, and we 
have to come back and” look first of all inside ourselves. It is best if we do 
not listen to or look at the person whom we consider to be the cause of our 
anger. Like a fireman, we have to pour water on the blaze first and not waste 
time looking for the one who set the house on fire. “Breathing in, I know 
that I am angry. Breathing out, I know that I must put all my energy into 
caring for my anger.” So we avoid thinking about the other person, and we 
refrain from doing or saying anything as long as our anger persists. If we put 
all our mind into observing our anger, we will avoid doing any damage that 
we may regret later. 

When we are angry, our anger is our very self. To suppress or chase it 
away is to suppress or chase away our self. When we are joyful, we are me 
joy. When we are angry, we are the anger. When anger is born in us, we can 
be aware that anger is an energy in us, and we can accept that energy in 
order to transform it into another kind of energy. When we have a compost 
bin filled with organic material which is decomposing and smelly, we know 
that we can transform the waste into beautiful flowers. At first, we may see 
the compost and the flowers as opposite, but when we look deeply, we see 
that the flowers already exist in the compost, and the compost already exists 



in the flowers. It only takes a couple of weeks for a flower to decompose. 
When a good organic gardener looks into her compost, she can see that, and 
she does not feel sad or disgusted. Instead, she values the rotting material 
and does not discriminate against it. It takes only a few months for compost 
to give birth to flowers. We need the insight and non-dual vision of the 
organic gardener with regard to our anger. We need not be afraid of it or 
reject it. We know that anger can be a kind of compost, and that it is within 
its power to give birth to something beautiful. We need anger in the way the 
organic gardener needs compost. If we know how to accept our anger, we 
already have some peace and joy. Gradually we can transform anger 
completely into peace, love, and understanding. 


Pillow-Pounding 

Expressing anger is not always the best way to deal with it. In expressing 
anger we might be practicing or rehearsing it, and making it stronger in the 
depth of our consciousness. Expressing anger to the person we arc angry at 
can cause a lot of damage. 

Some of us may prefer to go into our room, lock the door, and punch a 
pillow. We call this “getting in touch with our anger.” But I don’t think this 
is getting in touch with our anger at all. In fact, I don’t think it is even 
getting in touch with our pillow. If we are really in touch with the pillow, we 
know what a pillow is and we won’t hit it. Still, this technique may work 
temporarily because white pounding the pillow, we expend a lot of energy, 
and after a while, we arc exhausted and we feel better. But the roots of our 
anger are still intact, and if we go out and eat some nourishing food, our 
energy will be renewed. If the seeds of our anger are watered again, our 
anger will be reborn, and we will have to pound the pillow again. 

Pillow-pounding may provide some relief, but it is not very long-lasting. 
In order to have real transformation, we have to deal with the roots of our 
anger — looking deeply into its causes. If we don’t, the seeds of anger will 
grow again. If we practice mindful living, planting new, healthy, wholesome 
seeds, they will take care of our anger, and they may transform it without 
our asking them to do so. 

Our mindfulness will take care of everything, as the sunshine takes care of 
the vegetation. The sunshine does not seem to do much, it just shines on the 
vegetation, but it transforms everything. Poppies close up every time it gets 
dark, but when the sun shines on them for one or two hours, they open. The 
sun penetrates into the flowers, and at some point, the flowers cannot resist, 


they just have to open up. In the same way, mindfulness, if practiced 
continuously, will provide a kind of transformation within the flower of our 
anger, and it will open and show us its own nature. When we understand the 
nature, the roots, of our anger, we will be freed from it. 


Walking Meditation When Angry 

When anger arises, we may wish to go outside to practice walking 
meditation. The fresh air, the green trees, and the plants will help us greatly. 
We can practice like this: 

Breathing in, I know that anger is here. 

Breathing out, I know that the anger is me. 

Breathing in, I know that anger is unpleasant. 

Breathing out, I know this feeling mill pass. 

Breathing in, I am calm. 

Breathing out, lam strong enough to take care of this anger. 

To lessen the unpleasant feeling brought about by the anger, we give our 
whole heart and mind to the practice of walking meditation, combining our 
breath with our steps and giving full attention to the contact between the 
soles of our feet and the earth. As we walk, we recite this verse, and wait 
until we are calm enough to look directly at the anger. Until then, we can 
enjoy our breathing, our walking, and the beauties of our environment. After 
a while, our anger will subside and we will feel stronger. Then we can begin 
to observe the anger directly and try to understand it. 


Cooking Our Potatoes 

Thanks to the illuminating light of awareness, after practicing mindful 
observation for a while, we begin to see the primary causes of our anger. 
Meditation helps us look deeply into things in order to see their nature. If we 
look into our anger, we can see its roots, such as misunderstanding, 
clumsiness, injustice, resentment, or conditioning. These roots can be 
present in ourselves and in the person who played the principal rote in 
precipitating our anger. We observe mindfully in order to be able to see and 
to understand. Seeing and understanding are the elements of liberation that 
bring about love and compassion. The method of mindful observation in 
order to see and understand the roots of the anger is a method that has lasting 
effectiveness. 


We cannot eat raw potatoes, but we don’t throw them away just because 
they are raw. We know we can cook them. So, we put them into a pot of 
water, put a lid on, and put the pot on the fire. The fire is mindfulness, the 
practice of breathing consciously and focusing on our anger. The lid 
symbolizes our concentration, because it prevents the heat from going out of 
the pot. When we are practicing breathing in and out, looking into our anger, 
we need some concentration in order for our practice to be strong. Therefore, 
we turn away from all distractions and focus on the problem. If we go out 
into nature, among the trees and flowers, the practice is easier. As soon as 
we put the pot on the fire, a change occurs. The water begins to warm up. 
Ten minutes later, it boils, but we have to keep the fire going a while longer 
in order to cook our potatoes. As we practice being aware of our breathing 
and our anger, a transformation is already occurring. After half an hour, we 
lift the lid and smell something different. We know that we can eat our 
potatoes now. Anger has been transformed into another kind of energy — 
understanding and compassion. 


The Roots of Anger 

Anger is rooted in our lack of understanding of ourselves and of the 
causes, deep-seated as well as immediate, that brought about this unpleasant 
state of affairs. Anger is also rooted in desire, pride, agitation, and suspicion. 
The primary roots of our anger arc in ourselves. Our environment and other 
people are only secondary. It is not difficult for us to accept the enormous 
damage brought about by a natural disaster, such as an earthquake or a flood. 
But when damage is caused by another person, we don’t have much 
patience. We know that earthquakes and floods have causes, and we should 
see that the person who has precipitated our anger also has reasons, deep- 
seated and immediate, for what he has done. 

For instance, someone who speaks badly to us may have been spoken to 
in exactly the same way just the day before, or by his alcoholic father when 
he was a child. When we see and understand these kinds of causes, we can 
begin to be free from our anger. I am not saying that someone who viciously 
attacks us should not be disciplined. But what is most important is that we 
first take care of the seeds of negativity in ourselves. Then if someone needs 
to be helped or disciplined, we will do so out of compassion, not anger and 
retribution. If we genuinely try to understand the suffering of another person, 
we are more likely to act in a way that will help him overcome his suffering 
and confusion, and that will help all of us. 


Internal Formations 


There is a term in Buddhist psychology that can be translated as “internal 
formations,” “fetters,” or “knots.” When we have a sensory input, depending 
on how we receive it, a knot may be tied in us. When someone speaks 
unkindly to us, if we understand the reason and do not take his or her words 
to heart, we will not feel irritated at all, and no knot will be tied. But if we do 
not understand why we were spoken to that way and we become irritated, a 
knot will be tied in us. The absence of clear understanding is the basis for 
every knot. 

If we practice full awareness, we will be able to recognize internal 
formations as soon as they are formed, and we will find ways to transform 
them. For example, a wife may hear her husband boasting at a party, and 
inside herself she feels the formation of a lack of respect. If she discusses 
this with her husband, they may come to a clear understanding, and the knot 
in her will be untied easily. Internal formations need our full attention as 
soon as they manifest, while they are still weak, so that the work of 
transformation is easy. 

If we do not untie our knots when they form, they will grow tighter and 
stronger. Our conscious, reasoning mind knows that negative feelings such 
as anger, fear, and regret are not wholly acceptable to ourselves or society, 
so it finds ways to repress them, to push them into remote areas of our 
consciousness in order to forget them. Because we want to avoid suffering, 
we create defense mechanisms that deny the existence of these negative feel- 
ings and give us the impression we have peace within ourselves. But our 
internal formations are always looking for ways to manifest as destructive 
images, feelings, thoughts, words, or behavior. 

The way to deal with unconscious internal formations is, first of all, to 
find ways to become aware of them. By practicing mindful breathing, we 
may gain access to some of the knots that are tied inside us. When we are 
aware of our images, feelings, thoughts, words, and behavior, we can ask 
ourselves questions such as: Why did I feel uncomfortable when I heard him 
say that? Why did 1 say that to him? Why do I always think of my mother 
when I see that woman? Why didn’t I like that character in the movie? 
Whom did I hate in the past whom she resembles? Observing closely like 
this can gradually bring the internal formations that are buried in us into the 
realm of the conscious mind. 


During sitting meditation, after we have closed the doors and windows of 
sensory input, the internal formations buried inside us sometimes reveal 
themselves as images, feelings, or thoughts. We may notice a feeling of 
anxiety, tear, or unpleasantness whose cause we cannot understand. So we 
shine the light of our mindfulness on it, and prepare ourselves to see this 
image, feeling, or thought, in all its complexity. When it begins to show its 
face, it may gather strength and become more intense. We may find it so 
strong that it robs us of our peace, joy and ease, and we may not want to be 
in contact with it anymore. We may want to move our attention to another 
object of meditation or discontinue the meditation altogether; we may feel 
sleepy or say that we prefer to meditate some other time. In psychology, this 
is called resistance. We are afraid to bring into our conscious mind the 
feelings of pain that are buried in us, because they will make us suffer. But if 
we have been practicing breathing and smiling for some time, we will have 
developed the capacity to sit still and just observe our fears. As we keep in 
contact with our breathing and continue to smile, we can say, “Hello, Fear. 
There you are again.” 

There are people who practice sitting meditation many hours a day and 
never really face their feelings. Some of them say that feelings are not 
important, and they prefer to give their attention to metaphysical subjects. I 
am not suggesting that these other subjects of meditation are unimportant, 
but if they are not considered in relation to our real problems, our meditation 
is not really very valuable or helpful. 

If we know how to live every moment in an awakened way, we will be 
aware of what is going on in our feelings and perceptions in the present 
moment, and we will not let knots form or become tighter in our 
consciousness. And if we know how to observe our feelings, we can find the 
roots of long-standing internal formations and transform them, even those 
that have become quite strong. 


Living Together 

When we live with another person, to protect each other’ s happiness, we 
should help one another transform the internal formations that we produce 
together. By practicing understanding and loving speech, we can help each 
other a great deal. Happiness is no longer an individual matter. If the other 
person is not happy, we will not be happy either. To transform the other 
person’s knots will help bring about our own happiness as well. A wife can 
create internal formations in her husband, and a husband can do so in his 


wife, and if they continue to create knots in each other, one day there will be 
no happiness left. Therefore, as soon as a knot is created, the wife, for 
example, should know that a knot has just been tied in her. She should not 
overlook it. She should take the time to observe it and, with her husband’s 
help, transform it. She might say, “Darling, I think we’d better discuss a 
conflict I see growing.” This is easy when the states of mind of husband and 
wife are still light and not filled with too many knots. 

The root cause of any internal formation is a lack of understanding. If we 
can see the misunderstanding that was present during the creation of a knot, 
we can easily untie it. To practice mindful observation is to look deeply to 
be able to see the nature and causes of something. One important benefit of 
this kind of insight is the untying of our knots. 


Suchness 

In Buddhism, the word “suchness” is used to mean “the essence or 
particular characteristics of a thing or a person, its true nature.” Each person 
has his or her suchness. If we want to live in peace and happiness with a 
person, we have to see the suchness of that person. Once we see it, we 
understand him or her, and there will be no trouble. We can live peacefully 
and happily together. 

When we bring natural gas into our homes for heating and cooking, we 
know the suchness of gas. We know that gas is dangerous — it can kill us if 
we are not mindful. But we also know that we need the gas in order to cook, 
so we do not hesitate to bring it into our homes. The same is true of 
electricity. We could get electrocuted by it, but when we arc mindful, it can 
help us, and there is no problem, because we know something about the 
suchness of electricity. A person is the same. If we do not know enough 
about the suchness of that person, we may get ourselves into trouble. But if 
we know, then we can enjoy each other very much and benefit a lot from 
one another. The key is knowing a person’s suchness. We do not expect a 
person always to be a flower. We have to understand his or her garbage as 
well. 


Look into Your Hand 

I have a friend who is an artist. Before he left Vietnam forty years ago, his 
mother held his hand and told him, “Whenever you miss me, look into your 
hand, and you will see me immediately.” How penetrating these simple, 
sincere words! 


Over the years, my friend looked into his hand many times. 

The presence of his mother is not just genetic. Her spirit, her hopes, and 
her life are also in him. When he looks into his hand, he can see thousands 
of generations before him and thousands of generations after him. He can 
see that he exists not only in the evolutionary tree branching along the axis 
of time, but also in the network of interdependent relations. He told me that 
he never feels lonely. 

When my niece came to visit me last summer, I offered her “Look into 
Your Hand” as a subject for her meditation. I told her that every pebble, 
every leaf, and every butterfly are present in her hand. 


Parents 

When I think of my mother, I cannot separate her image from my idea of 
love, for love was the natural ingredient in the sweet, soft tones of her voice. 
On the day I lost my mother, I wrote in my diary, “The greatest tragedy in 
my life has just happened.” Even as an adult living away from my mother, 
her loss left me feeling as abandoned as a small orphan. 

I know that many friends in the West do not feel the same way about their 
parents. I have heard many stories about parents who have hurt their children 
so much, planting many seeds of suffering in them. But I believe that the 
parents did not mean to plant those seeds. They did not intend to make their 
children suffer. Maybe they received the same kind of seeds from their 
parents. There is a continuation in the transmission of seeds and their father 
and mother might have gotten those seeds from their grandfather and 
grandmother. Most of us are victims of a kind of living that is not mindful, 
and the practice of mindful living, of meditation, can stop these kinds of 
suffering and end the transmission of such sorrow to our children and 
grandchildren. We can break the cycle by not allowing these kinds of seeds 
of suffering to be transmitted to our children, our friends, or anyone else. 

A fourteen-year-old boy who practices at Plum Village told me this story. 
When he was eleven, he was very angry at his father. Every time he fell 
down and hurt himself, his father would shout at him. The boy vowed to 
himself that when he grew up, he would be different. But last year, his little 
sister was playing with other children and she fell off a swing and scraped 
her knee. It was bleeding, and the boy became very angry. He wanted to 
shout at her, “How stupid! Why did you do that?” But he caught himself. 
Because he had practiced breathing and mindfulness, he could recognize his 
anger and he did not act on it. 


The adults were taking good care of his sister, washing her wound and 
putting a band-aid on it, so he walked away slowly and practiced breathing 
on his anger. Suddenly he saw that he was exactly like his father. He told 
me, “I realized that if I didn’t do something about the anger in me, I would 
transmit it to my children.” At the same time, he saw something else. He saw 
that his father may have been a victim just like him. The seeds of his father’s 
anger might have been transmitted by his grandparents. It was a remarkable 
insight for a fourteen-year-old boy, but because he had been practicing 
mindfulness, he could see like that. “I told myself to continue practicing in 
order to transform my anger into something else.” And after a few months, 
his anger disappeared. Then he was able to bring the fruit of his practice 
back to his father, and he told him that he used to be angry at him, but now 
he understood. He said he wished that his father would practice also, in order 
to transform his own seeds of anger. We usually think that parents have to 
nourish their children, hut sometimes the children can bring enlightenment 
to the parents and help transform them. 

When we look at our parents with compassion, often we see that our 
parents are only victims who never had the chance to practice mindfulness. 
They could not transform the suffering in themselves. But if we see them 
with compassionate eyes, we can offer them joy, peace, and forgiveness. In 
fact, when we look deeply, we discover that it is impossible to drop all 
identity with our parents. 

Whenever we take a bath or a shower, if we look closely at our body, we 
will see that it is a gift from our parents and their parents. As we wash each 
part of our body, we can meditate on the nature of the body and the nature of 
life, asking ourselves, “To whom does this body belong? Who has given this 
body to me? What has been given?” If we meditate in this way, we will dis- 
cover that there are three components: the giver, the gift, and the one who 
receives the gift. The giver is our parents; we are the continuation of our 
parents and our ancestors. The gift is our body itself. The one who receives 
the gift is us. As we continue to meditate on this, we see clearly that the 
giver, the gift, and the receiver are one. All three are present in our body. 
When we are deeply in touch with the present moment, we can see that all 
our ancestors and all future generations are present in us. Seeing this, we 
will know what to do and what not to do — for ourselves, our ancestors, our 
children, and their children. 


Nourishing Healthy Seeds 


Consciousness exists on two levels: as seeds and as manifestations of 
these seeds. Suppose we have a seed of anger in us. When conditions are 
favorable, that seed may manifest as a zone of energy called anger. It is 
burning, and it makes us suffer a lot. It is very difficult for us to be joyful at 
the moment the seed of anger manifests. 

Every time a seed has an occasion to manifest itself, it produces new 
seeds of the same kind. If we are angry for five minutes, new seeds of anger 
are produced and deposited in the soil of our unconscious mind during those 
five minutes. That is why we have to be careful in selecting the kind of life 
we lead and the emotions we express. When I smile, the seeds of smiling 
and joy have come up. As long as they manifest, new seeds of smiling and 
joy are planted. But if I don’t practice smiling for a number of years, that 
seed will weaken, and I may not be able to smile anymore. 

There are many kinds of seeds in us, both good and had. Some were 
planted during our lifetime, and some were transmitted by our parents, our 
ancestors, and our society. In a tiny grain of corn, there is the knowledge, 
transmitted by previous generations, of how to sprout and how to make 
leaves, flowers, and ears of com. Our body and our mind also have 
knowledge that has been transmitted by previous generations. Our ancestors 
and our parents have given us seeds of joy, peace, and happiness, as well as 
seeds of sorrow, anger, and so on. 

Every time we practice mindful living, we plant healthy seeds and 
strengthen the healthy seeds already in us. Healthy seeds function similarly 
Co antibodies. When a virus enters our bloodstream, our body reacts and 
antibodies come and surround it, take care of it, and transform it. This is true 
with our psychological seeds as well. If we plant wholesome, healing, 
refreshing seeds, they will take care of the negative seeds, even without our 
asking them. To succeed, we need to cultivate a good reserve of refreshing 
seeds. 

One day, in the village where I live, we lost a very close friend, a 
Frenchman who helped us considerably in setting up Plum Village. He had a 
heart attack and died during the night. In the morning we learned of his 
passing. He was such a gracious person, and he gave us a lot of joy every 
time we spent a few minutes with him. We felt that he was joy and peace 
itself. The morning we found out about his death, we regretted very much 
that we had not spent more time with him. 

That night, I couldn’t sleep. The loss of a friend like him was so painful. 
But I had to deliver a lecture the next morning, and I wanted to sleep, so I 



practiced breathing. It was a cold, winter night, and I was lying in bed 
visualizing the beautiful trees in the yard of my hermitage. Years before, I 
had planted three beautiful cedars, a variety from the Himalayas. The trees 
are now very big, and, during walking meditation, I used to stop and hug 
these beautiful cedars, breathing in and out. The cedars always responded to 
my hugging, I am sure of it. So I lay in bed, and just breathed in and out, 
becoming the cedars and my breath. I felt much better, but still 1 couldn’t 
sleep. Finally I invited into my consciousness the image of a delightful 
Vietnamese child named Little Bamboo. She came to Plum Village when 
she was two years old, and she was so cute that everyone wanted to hold her 
in their arms, especially the children. They didn’t let Little Bamboo walk on 
the ground! Now she is six years old, and holding her in your arms, you feel 
very fresh, very wonderful. So I invited her to come up into my 
consciousness, and I practiced breathing and smiling on her image. In just a 
few moments, I fell soundly asleep. 

Each of us needs a reserve of seeds that are beautiful, healthy, and strong 
enough to help us during difficult moments. Sometimes, because the block 
of pain in us is so big, even though a flower is right in front of us, we cannot 
touch it. At that moment, we know that we need help. If we have a strong 
storehouse of healthy seeds, we can invite several of them to come up and 
help us. If you have a friend who is very close to you, who understands you, 
if you know that when you sit close to her, even without saying anything, 
you will feel better, then you can invite her image up into your 
consciousness, and the “two” of you can “breathe together.” Doing just this 
may be a big help in difficult moments. 

But if you have not seen your friend in a long time, her image may be too 
weak in your consciousness to come easily to you. If you know that she is 
the only person who can help you reestablish your balance and if your image 
of her is already too weak, there is only one thing to do: buy a ticket and go 
to her, so that she is with you not as a seed, but as a real person. 

If you go to her, you have to know how to spend the time well, because 
your time with her is limited. When you arrive, sit close to her, and right 
away you will feel stronger. Rut you know that soon you will have to return 
home, so you have to take the opportunity to practice full awareness in each 
precious moment while you arc there. Your friend can help you re-establish 
the balance within you, but that is not enough. You yourself must become 
strong inside, in order to feel all right when you are alone again. That is 
why, sitting with her or walking with her, you need to practice mindfulness. 
If you don’t, if you just use her presence to ameliorate your suffering, the 



seed of her image will not become strong enough to sustain you when you 
return home. We need to practice mindfulness all the time so that we plant 
healing, refreshing seeds in ourselves. Then, when we need them, they will 
take care of us. 


What’s Not Wrong? 

We often ask, “What’s wrong?” Doing so, we invite painful seeds of 
sorrow to come up and manifest. We feel suffering, anger, and depression, 
and produce more such seeds. We would be much happier if we tried to stay 
in touch with the healthy, joyful seeds inside of us and around us. We should 
learn to ask, “What’s not wrong?” and be in touch with that. There are so 
many elements in the world and within our bodies, feelings, perceptions, and 
consciousness that are wholesome, refreshing, and healing. If we block 
ourselves, if we stay in the prison of our sorrow, we will not be in touch with 
these healing elements. 

Life is filled with many wonders, like the blue sky, the sunshine, the eyes 
of a baby. Our breathing, for example, can be very enjoyable. I enjoy 
breathing every day. But many people appreciate the joy of breathing only 
when they have asthma or a stuffed-up nose. We don’t need to wait until we 
have asthma to enjoy our breathing. Awareness of the precious elements of 
happiness is itself the practice of right mindfulness. Elements like these are 
within us and all around us. In each second of our lives we can enjoy them. 
If we do so, seeds of peace, joy, and happiness will be planted in us, and 
they will become strong. The secret to happiness is happiness itself. 
Wherever we are, any time, we have the capacity to enjoy the sunshine, the 
presence of each other, and the wonder of our breathing. We don’t have to 
travel anywhere else to do so. We can be in touch with these things right 
now. 


Blaming Never Helps 

When you plant lettuce, if it does not grow well, you don’t blame the 
lettuce. You look into the reasons it is not doing well. It may need fertilizer, 
or more water, or less sun. You never blame the lettuce. Yet if we have 
problems with our friends or our family, we blame the other person. But if 
we know how to take care of them, they will grow well, like lettuce. 
Blaming has no positive effect at all, nor does trying to persuade using 
reason and arguments. That is my experience. No blame, no reasoning, no 
argument, just understanding. If you understand, and you show that you 


understand, you can love, and the situation will change. One day in Paris, I 
gave a lecture about not blaming the lettuce. After the talk, I was doing 
walking meditation by myself, and when I turned the corner of a building, I 
overheard an eight-year-old girl telling her mother, “Mommy, remember to 
water me. I am your lettuce.” I was so pleased that she had understood my 
point completely. Then I heard her mother reply. “Yes, my daughter, and I 
am your lettuce also. So please don’t forget to water me too.” Mother and 
daughter practicing together, it was very beautiful. 


Understanding 

Understanding and love are not two things, but just one. Suppose your son 
wakes up one morning and sees that it is already quite late. He decides to 
wake up his younger sister, to give her enough time to eat breakfast before 
going to school. It happens that she is grouchy and instead of saying, “Thank 
you for waking me up,” she says, “Shut up! Leave me alone!” and kicks 
him. He will probably get angry, thinking, “I woke her up nicely. Why did 
she kick me?” He may want to go to the kitchen and tell you about it, or 
even kick her back. 

But then he remembers that during the night his sister coughed a lot, and 
he realizes that she must be sick. Maybe she behaved so meanly because she 
has a cold. At that moment, he understands, and he is not angry at all 
anymore. When you understand, you cannot help but love. You cannot get 
angry. To develop understanding, you have to practice looking at all living 
beings with the eyes of’ compassion. When you understand, you cannot help 
but love. And when you love, you naturally act in a way that can relieve the 
suffering of people. 


Real Love 

We really have to understand the person we want to love. If our love is 
only a will to possess, it is not love. If we only think of ourselves, if we 
know only our own needs and ignore the needs of the other person, we 
cannot love. We must look deeply in order to see and understand the needs, 
aspirations, and suffering of the person we love. This is the ground of real 
love. You cannot resist loving another person when you really understand 
him or her. From time to time, sit close to the one you love, hold his or her 
hand, and ask, “Darling, do I understand you enough? Or am I making you 
suffer? Please tell me so that I can learn to love you properly. I don’t want to 
make you suffer, and if I do so because of my ignorance, please tell me so 


that I can love you better, so that you can be happy.” If you say this in a 
voice that communicates your real openness to understand, the other person 
may cry. 

That is a good sign, because it means the door of understanding is opening 
and everything will be possible again. 

Maybe a father does not have time or is not brave enough to ask his son 
such a question. Then the love between them will not be as full as it could 
be. We need courage to ask these questions, but if we don’t ask, the more we 
love, the more we may destroy the people we are trying to love. True love 
needs understanding. With understanding, the one we love will certainly 
flower. 


Meditation on Compassion 

Love is a mind that brings peace, joy, and happiness to another person. 
Compassion is a mind that removes the suffering that is present in the other. 
We all have the seeds of love and compassion in our minds, and we can 
develop these fine and wonderful sources of energy. We can nurture the 
unconditional love that does not expect anything in return and therefore does 
not lead to anxiety and sorrow. 

The essence of love and compassion is understanding, the ability to 
recognize the physical, material, and psychological suffering of others, to 
put ourselves “inside the skin” of the other. We “go inside” their body, 
feelings, and mental formations, and witness for ourselves their suffering. 
Shallow observation as an outsider is not enough to see their suffering. We 
must become one with the object of our observation. When we are in contact 
with another’s suffering, a feeling of compassion is born in us. Compassion 
means, literally, “to suffer with.” 

We begin by choosing as the object of our meditation someone who is 
undergoing physical or material suffering, someone who is weak and easily 
ill, poor or oppressed, or has no protection. This kind of suffering is easy for 
us to see. After that, we can practice being in contact with more subtle forms 
of suffering. Sometimes the other person does not seem to be suffering at all, 
but we may notice that he has sorrows which have left their marks in hidden 
ways. People with more than enough material comforts also suffer. We look 
deeply at the person who is the object of our meditation on compassion, both 
during sitting meditation and when we are actually in contact with him. We 
must allow enough time to be really in deep contact with his suffering. We 
continue to observe him until compassion arises and penetrates our being. 


When we observe deeply in this way, the fruit of our meditation will 
naturally transform into some kind of action. We will not just say, “I love 
him very much,” but instead. “I will do something so that he will suffer 
less.” The mind of compassion is truly present when it is effective in 
removing another person’s suffering. We have to find ways to nourish and 
express our compassion. When we come into contact with the other person, 
our thoughts and actions should express our mind of compassion, even if 
that person says and does things that are not easy to accept. We practice in 
this way until we see clearly that our love is not contingent upon the other 
person being lovable. Then we can know that our mind of compassion is 
firm and authentic. We ourselves will be more at ease, and the person who 
has been the object of our meditation will also benefit eventually. His 
suffering will slowly diminish, and his life will gradually be brighter and 
more joyful as a result of our compassion. 

We can also meditate on the suffering of those who cause us to suffer. 
Anyone who has made us suffer is undoubtedly suffering too. We only need 
to follow our breathing and look deeply, and naturally we will see his 
suffering. A part of his difficulties and sorrows may have been brought 
about by his parents’ lack of skill when he was still young. But his parents 
themselves may have been victims of their parents; the suffering has been 
transmitted from generation to generation and been reborn in him. If we see 
that, we will no longer blame him for making us suffer, because we know 
that he is also a victim. To look deeply is to understand. Once we understand 
the reasons he has acted badly, our bitterness towards him will vanish, and 
we will long for him to suffer less. We will feel cool and light, and we can 
smile. We do not need the other person to be present in order to bring about 
reconciliation. When we look deeply, we become reconciled with ourselves, 
and, for us, the problem no longer exists. Sooner or later, he will see our 
attitude and will share in the freshness of the stream of love which is flowing 
naturally from our heart. 


Meditation on Love 

The mind of love brings peace, joy, and happiness to ourselves and others. 
Mindful observation is the element which nourishes the tree of 
understanding, and compassion and love are the most beautiful flowers. 
When we realize the mind of love, we have to go to the one who has been 
the object of our mindful observation, so that our mind of love is not just an 
object of our imagination, but a source of energy which has a real effect in 
the world. The meditation on love is not just sitting still and visualizing that 


our love will spread out into space like waves of sound or light. Sound and 
light have the ability to penetrate everywhere, and love and compassion can 
do the same. But if our love is only a kind of imagination, then it is not 
likely to have any real effect. It is in the midst of our daily life and in our 
actual contact with others that we can know whether our mind of love is 
really present and how stable it is. If love is real, it will be evident in our 
daily life, in the way we relate with people and the world. 

The source of love is deep in us, and we can help others realize a lot of 
happiness. One word, one action, or one thought can reduce another person’s 
suffering and bring him joy. One word can give comfort and confidence, 
destroy doubt, help someone avoid a mistake, reconcile a conflict, or open 
the door to liberation. One action can save a person’s life or help him take 
advantage of a rare opportunity. One thought can do the same, because 
thoughts always lead to words and actions. If love is in our heart, every 
thought, word, and deed can bring about a miracle. Because understanding is 
the very foundation of love, words and actions that emerge from our love are 
always helpful. 


Hugging Meditation 

Hugging is a beautiful Western custom, and we from the East would like 
to contribute the practice of conscious breathing to it. When you hold a child 
in your arms, or hug your mother, or your husband, or your friend, if you 
breathe in and out three times, your happiness will be multiplied at least 
tenfold. 

If you are distracted, thinking about other things, your hug will be 
distracted also, not very deep, and you may not enjoy hugging very much. 
So when you hug your child, your friend, your spouse, I recommend that 
you first breathe in and out consciously and return to the present moment. 
Then, while you hold him or her in your arms, breathe three times 
consciously, and you will enjoy your hugging more than ever before. 

We practiced hugging meditation at a retreat for psychotherapists in 
Colorado, and one retreatant, when he returned home to Philadelphia, 
hugged his wife at the airport in a way he had never hugged her before. 
Because of that, his wife attended our next retreat, in Chicago. 

It takes time to become comfortable hugging this way. If you feel a little 
hollow inside, you may want to slap your friend’ s back while you hug him in 
order to prove that you are really there. But to be really there, you only need 


to breathe, and suddenly he becomes completely real. The two of you really 
exist in that moment. It may be one of the best moments in your life. 

Suppose your daughter comes and presents herself to you. If you are not 
really there — if you are thinking of the past, worrying about the future, or 
possessed by anger or fear — the child, although standing in front of you, will 
not exist for you. She is like a ghost, and you may be like a ghost also. If you 
want to be with her, you have to return to the present moment. Breathing 
consciously, uniting body and mind, you make yourself into a real person 
again. When you become a real person, your daughter becomes real also. 
She is a wondrous presence, and a real encounter with life is possible at that 
moment. If you hold her in your arms and breathe, you will awaken to the 
preciousness of your loved one, and life is. 


Investing in Friends 

Even if we have a lot of money in the bank, we can die very easily from 
our suffering. So, investing in a friend, making a friend into a real friend, 
building a community of friends, is a much better source of security. We will 
have someone to lean on, to come to, during our difficult moments. 

We can gel in touch with the refreshing, healing elements within and 
around us thanks to the loving support of other people. If we have a good 
community of friends, we are very fortunate. To create a good community, 
we first have to transform ourselves into a good element of the community. 
After that, we can go to another person and help him or her become an 
element of the community. We build our network of friends that way. We 
have to think of friends and community as investments, as our most 
important asset. They can comfort us and help us in difficult times, and they 
can share our joy and happiness. 


It Is a Great Joy to Hold Your Grandchild 

You know that elderly people are very sad when they have to live 
separately from their children and grandchildren. This is one of the things in 
the West that I do not like. In my country, aged people have the right to live 
with the younger people. It is the grandparents who tell fairy tales to the 
children. When they get old, their skin is cold and wrinkled, and it is a great 
joy for them to hold their grandchild, so warm and tender. When a person 
grows old, his deepest hope is to have a grandchild to hold in his arms. He 
hopes for it day and night, and when he hears that his daughter or daughter- 
in-law is pregnant, he is so happy. Nowadays the elderly have to go to a 


home where they live only among other aged people. Just once a week they 
receive a short visit, and afterwards they feel even sadder. We have to find 
ways for old and young people to live together again. It will make all of us 
very happy. 


Community of Mindful Living 

The foundation of a good community is a daily life that is joyful and 
happy. In Plum Village, children are the center of attention. Each adult is 
responsible for helping the children be happy, because we know that if the 
children are happy, it is easy for the adults to be happy. 

When I was a child, families were bigger. Parents, cousins, uncles, aunts, 
grandparents, and children all lived together. The houses were surrounded 
by trees where we could hang hammocks and organize picnics. In those 
times, people did not have many of the problems we have today. Now our 
families are very small, just mother, father, and one or two children. When 
the parents have a problem, the whole family feels the effects. Even if the 
children go into the bathroom to try to get away, they can feel the heavy 
atmosphere. They may grow up with seeds of suffering and never be truly 
happy. Formerly, when mom and dad had problems, the children could 
escape by going to an aunt or uncle, or other family member. They still had 
someone to look up to, and the atmosphere was not so threatening. 

I think that communities of mindful living, where we can visit a network 
of “aunts, uncles, and cousins,” may help us replace our former big families. 
Each of us needs to “belong to” such a place, where each feature of the 
landscape, the sounds of the bell, and even the buildings are designed to 
remind us to return to awareness. I imagine that there will be beautiful 
practice centers where regular retreats will be organized, and individuals and 
families will go there to learn and practice the art of mindful living. 

The people who live there should emanate peace and freshness, the fruits 
of living in awareness. They will he like beautiful trees, and the visitors will 
want to come and sit under their shade. Even when they cannot actually 
visit, they only need to think of it and smile, and they will feel themselves 
becoming peaceful and happy. 

We can also transform our own family or household into a community 
that practices harmony and awareness. Together we can practice breathing 
and smiling, sitting together, drinking tea together in mindfulness. If we 
have a bell, the bell is also part of the community, because the hell helps us 
practice. If we have a meditation cushion, the cushion is also part of the 


community, as are many other things that help us practice mindfulness, such 
as the air for breathing. If we live near a park or a riverbank, we can enjoy 
walking meditation there. All these efforts can help us establish a 
community at home. From time to time we can invite a friend to join us. 
Practicing mindfulness is much easier with a community. 


Mindfulness Must Be Engaged 

When I was in Vietnam, so many of our villages were being bombed. 
Along with my monastic brothers and sisters, I had to decide what to do. 
Should we continue to practice in our monasteries, or should we leave the 
meditation halls in order to help the people who were suffering under the 
bombs? After careful reflection, we decided to do both — to go out and help 
people and to do so in mindfulness. We called it engaged Buddhism. 
Mindfulness must be engaged. Once there is seeing, there must be acting. 
Otherwise, what is the use of seeing? 

We must be aware of the real problems of the world. Then, with 
mindfulness, we will know what to do and what not to do to be of help. If we 
maintain awareness of our breathing and continue to practice smiling, even 
in difficult situations, many people, animals, and plants will benefit from our 
way of doing things. Are you massaging our Mother Earth every time your 
foot touches her? Are you planting seeds of joy and peace? I try to do 
exactly that with every step, and I know that our Mother Earth is most 
appreciative. Peace is every step. Shall we continue our journey? 

PART THREE 

Peace Is Every Step 


Interfacing 

If you are a poet, you will see clearly that there is a cloud floating in this 
sheet of paper. Without a cloud, there will be no rain; without rain, the trees 
cannot grow; and without trees, we cannot make paper. The cloud is 
essential for the paper to exist. It the cloud is not here, the sheet of paper 
cannot be here either. So we can say that the cloud and the paper inter-are. 
“Interbeing” is a word that is not in the dictionary yet, but if we combine the 
prefix “inter-” with the verb “to be,” we have a new verb, inter-be. 

If we look into this sheet of paper even more deeply, we can see the 
sunshine in it. Without sunshine, the forest cannot grow. In fact, nothing can 


grow without sunshine. And so, we know that the sunshine is also in this 
sheet of paper. The paper and the sunshine inter-are. And if we continue to 
look, we can see the logger who cut the tree and brought it to the mill to be 
transformed into paper. And we see wheat. We know that the logger cannot 
exist without his daily bread, and therefore the wheat that became his bread 
is also in this sheet of paper. The logger’s father and mother are in it too. 
When we look in this way, we see that without all of these things, this sheet 
of paper cannot exist. 

Looking even more deeply, we can see ourselves in this sheet of paper 
too. This is not difficult to see, because when we look at a sheet of paper, it 
is part of our perception. Your mind is in here and mine is also. So we can 
say that everything is in here with this sheet of paper. We cannot point out 
one thing that is not here — time, space, the earth, the rain, the minerals in the 
soil, the sunshine, the cloud, the river, the heat. Everything co-exists with 
this sheet of paper. That is why I think the word inter-be should be in the 
dictionary. “To be” is to inter-be. We cannot just be by ourselves alone. We 
have to inter-he with every other thing. This sheet of paper is, because 
everything else is. 

Suppose we try to return one of the elements to its source. Suppose we 
return the sunshine to the sun. Do you think that this sheet of paper will be 
possible? No, without sunshine nothing can be. And if we return the logger 
to his mother, then we have no sheet of paper either. The fact is that this 
sheet of paper is made up only of “non-paper” elements. And if we return 
these non-paper elements to their sources, then there can be no paper at all. 
Without non-paper elements, like mind, logger, and sunshine and so on, 
there will be no paper. As thin as this sheet of paper is, it contains everything 
in the universe in it. 


Flowers and Garbage 

Defiled or immaculate. Dirty or pure. These are concepts we form in our 
mind. A beautiful rose we have just cut and placed in our vase is pure. It 
smells so good, so fresh. A garbage can is the opposite. It smells horrible, 
and it is filled with rotten things. But that is only when we look on the 
surface. If we look more deeply we will see that in just five or six days, the 
rose will become part of the garbage. We do not need to wait five days to see 
it. If we just look at the rose, and we look deeply, we can see it now. And if 
we look into the garbage can, we see that in a few months its contents can be 
transformed into lovely vegetables, and even a rose. If you are a good 


organic gardener, looking at a rose you can see the garbage, and looking at 
the garbage you can see a rose. Roses and garbage inter-are. Without a rose, 
we cannot have garbage; and without garbage, we cannot have a rose. They 
need each other very much. The rose and the garbage are equal. The garbage 
is just as precious as the rose. If we look deeply at the concepts of 
defilement and immaculateness, we return to the notion of interbeing. 

In the city of Manila there are many young prostitutes; some are only 
fourteen or fifteen years old. They are very unhappy. They did not want to 
be prostitutes, but their families are poor and these young girls went to the 
city to look for some kind of job, like street vendor, to make money to send 
back to their families. Of course this is true not only in Manila, but in Ho 
Chi Minh City in Vietnam, in New York City, and in Paris also. After only a 
few weeks in the city, a vulnerable girl can be persuaded by a clever person 
to work for him and earn perhaps one hundred times more money than she 
could as a street vendor. Because she is so young and does not know much 
about life, she accepts and becomes a prostitute. Since that time, she has 
carried the feeling of being impure, defiled, and this causes her great 
suffering. When she looks at other young girls, dressed beautifully, 
belonging to good families, a wretched feeling wells up in her, a feeling of 
defilement that becomes her hell. 

But if she could look deeply at herself and at the whole situation, she 
would see that she is the way she is because other people are the way they 
are. How can a “good girl,” belonging to a good family, be proud? Because 
the “good family’s” way of life is the way it is, the prostitute has to live as a 
prostitute. No one among us has clean hands. No one of us can claim that it 
is not our responsibility. The girl in Manila is that way because of the way 
we are. Looking into the life of that young prostitute, we see the lives of all 
the “non-prostitutes.” And looking at the non-prostitutes and the way we live 
our lives, we see the prostitute. Each thing helps to create the other. 

Let us look at wealth and poverty. The affluent society and the deprived 
society inter-are. The wealth of one society is made of the poverty of the 
other. “This is like this, because that is like that.” Wealth is made of non- 
wealth elements, and poverty is made by non-poverty elements. It is exactly 
the same as with the sheet of paper. So we must be careful not to imprison 
ourselves in concepts. The truth is that everything contains everything else. 
We cannot just be, we can only inter-be. We are responsible for everything 
that happens around us. 

Only by seeing with the eyes of interbeing can that young girl be freed 
from her suffering. Only then will she understand that she is bearing the 



burden of die whole world. What else can we offer her? Looking deeply into 
ourselves, we see her, and we will share her pain and the pain of the whole 
world. Then we can begin to be of real help. 


Waging Peace 

If the Earth were your body, you would be able to feel the many-areas 
where it is suffering. War, political and economic oppression, famine, and 
pollution wreak havoc in so many places. Every day, children are becoming 
blind from malnutrition, their hands searching hopelessly through mounds of 
trash for a few ounces of food. Adults are dying slowly in prisons for trying 
to oppose violence. Rivers are dying, and the air is becoming more and more 
difficult to breathe. Although the two great superpowers are becoming a 
little more friendly, they still have enough nuclear weapons to destroy the 
Earth dozens of times. 

Many people are aware of the world’s suffering; their hearts are filled 
with compassion. They know what needs to be done, and they engage in 
political, social, and environmental work to try to change things. But after a 
period of intense involvement, they may become discouraged if they lack the 
strength needed to sustain a life of action. Real strength is not in power, 
money, or weapons, but in deep, inner peace. 

Practicing mindfulness in each moment of our daily lives, we can 
cultivate our own peace. With clarity, determination, and patience — the 
fruits of meditation — we can sustain a life of action and he real instruments 
of peace. I have seen this peace in people of various religious and cultural 
backgrounds who spend their time and energy protecting the weak, 
struggling for social justice, lessening the disparity between rich and poor, 
stopping the arms race, fighting against discrimination, and watering the 
trees of love and understanding throughout the world. 


Not Two 

When we want to understand something, we cannot just stand outside and 
observe it. We have to enter deeply into it and be one with it in order to 
really understand. If we want to understand a person, we have to feel his 
feelings, suffer his sufferings, and enjoy his joy. The word “comprehend” is 
made up of the Latin roots cum, which means “with,” and prehendere, which 
means “to grasp it or pick it up.” To comprehend something means to pick it 
up and be one with it. There is no other way to understand something. In 
Buddhism, we call this kind of understanding “non-duality.” Not two. 


Fifteen years ago, I helped a committee for orphans who were victims of 
the war m Vietnam. From Vietnam, the social workers sent out applications, 
one sheet of paper with a small picture of a child in the corner, telling the 
name, age, and conditions of the orphan. My job was to translate die 
application from Vietnamese into French in order to seek a sponsor, so that 
the child would have food to eat and books for school, and be put into the 
family of an aunt, an uncle, or a grandparent. Then [he committee in France 
could send the money to the family member to help take care of the child. 

Each day I helped translate about thirty applications. The way I did it was 
to look at the picture of the child. I did not read the application; I just took 
time to look at the picture of the child. Usually after only thirty or forty 
seconds, I became one with the child. Then I would pick up the pen and 
translate the words from the application onto another sheet. Afterwards I 
realized that it was not me who had translated the application; it was the 
child and me, who had become one. Looking at his or her face, I felt 
inspired, and I became the child and he or she became me, and together we 
did the translation. It is very natural. You don’t have to practice a lot of 
meditation to be able to do that. You just look, allowing yourself to be, and 
you lose yourself in the child, and the child in you. 


Healing the Wounds of War 

If only the United States had had the vision of non-duality concerning 
Vietnam, we would not have had so much destruction in both countries. The 
war continues to hurt both Americans and Vietnamese. If we are attentive 
enough, we can still learn from the war in Vietnam. 

Last year we had a wonderful retreat with Vietnam veterans in America. It 
was a difficult retreat, because many of us could not get free of our pain. 
One gentleman told me that in Vietnam, he lost four hundred seventeen 
people in one battle alone, in one day. Lour hundred seventeen men died in 
one battle, and he has had to live with that for more than fifteen years. 
Another person told me that out of anger and revenge, he took the life of 
children in a village, and after that, he lost all his peace. Ever since that time, 
he has not been able to sit alone with children in a room. There are many 
kinds of suffering, and they can prevent us from being in touch with the non- 
suffering world. 

We must practice helping each other be in touch. One soldier told me that 
this retreat was the first time in fifteen years that he felt safe in a group of 
people. Lor fifteen years, he could not swallow solid food easily. He could 


only drink some fruit juice and eat some fruit. He was completely shut off 
and could not communicate. But after three or four days of practice, he 
began to open up and talk to people. You have to offer a lot of loving kind- 
ness in order to help such a person touch things again. During the retreat, we 
practiced mindful breathing and smiling, encouraging each other to come 
back to the flower in us, and to the trees and the blue sky that shelter us. 

We had a silent breakfast. We practiced eating breakfast the way I ate the 
cookie of my childhood. We did things like that, making mindful steps in 
order to touch the Earth, breathing consciously in order to touch the air, and 
looking at our tea deeply in order to really be in touch with the tea. We sat 
together, breathed together, walked together, and tried to learn from our 
experience in Vietnam. The veterans have something to tell their nation 
about how to deal with other problems that are likely to happen, problems 
that will not look different from Vietnam. Out of our sufferings, we should 
learn something. 

We need the vision of interbeing — we belong to each other; we cannot cut 
reality into pieces. The well-being of “this” is the well-being of “that,” so we 
have to do things together. Every side is “our side”; there is no evil side. 
Veterans have experience that makes them the light at the tip of the candle, 
illuminating the roots of war and the way to peace. 


The Sun My Heart 

We know that if our heart stops beating, the flow of our life will stop, and 
so we cherish our heart very much. Yet we do not often take the time to 
notice that other things, outside of our bodies, are also essential for our 
survival. Look at the immense light we call the sun. If it were to stop 
shining, the flow of our life would also stop, so the sun is our second heart, a 
heart outside of our body. This immense “heart” gives all life on Earth the 
warmth necessary for existence. Plants live thanks to the sun. Their leaves 
absorb the sun’s energy, along with carbon dioxide from the air, to produce 
food for the tree, the flower, the plankton. And thanks to plants, we and 
other animals can live. All of us — people, animals, and plants — consume 
the sun, directly and indirectly. We cannot begin to describe all the effects of 
the sun, that great heart outside of our body. 

Our body is not limited to what is inside the boundary of our skin. It is 
much more immense. It includes even the layer of air around our Earth; for 
if the atmosphere were to disappear for even an instant, our life would end. 
There is no phenomenon in the universe that does not intimately concern us, 


from a pebble resting at the bottom of the ocean, to the movement of a 
galaxy millions of light-years away. Walt Whitman said, “I believe a leaf of 
grass is no less than the journey-work of the stars. . . .” These words are not 
philosophy. They come from the depths of his soul. He said, “I am large, I 
contain multitudes.” 


Looking Deeply 

We have to look deeply at things in order to see. When a swimmer enjoys 
the clear water of the river, he or she should also be able to be the river. One 
day, during one of my first visits to the United States, I was having lunch at 
Boston University with some friends, and I looked down at the Charles 
River. I had been away from home for quite a long time, and seeing the 
river, I found it very beautiful. So I left my friends and went down to wash 
my face and dip my feet in the water, as we used to do in our country. When 
I returned, a professor said, “That’s a very dangerous thing to do. Did you 
rinse your mouth in the river?” When I told him yes, he said, “You should 
see a doctor and get a shot.” 

1 was shocked. I hadn’t known that the rivers here were so polluted. Some 
of them are called “dead rivers.” In our country the rivers get very muddy 
sometimes, but not that kind of dirty. Someone told me that the Rhine River 
in Germany contains so many chemicals that it is possible to develop 
photographs in it. If we want to continue to enjoy our rivers — to swim in 
them, walk beside them, even drink their water — we have to adopt the non- 
dual perspective. We have to meditate on being the river so that we can 
experience within ourselves the fears and hopes of the river. If we cannot 
feel the rivers, the mountains, the air, the animals, and other people from 
within their own perspective, the rivers will die and we will lose our chance 
for peace. 

If you are a mountain climber or someone who enjoys the countryside, or 
the green forest, you know that the forests are our lungs outside of our 
bodies, just as the sun is our heart outside of our bodies. Yet we have been 
acting in a way that has allowed two million square miles of forest land to be 
destroyed by acid rain, and we have destroyed parts of the ozone layer that 
regulate how much direct sunlight we receive. We are imprisoned in our 
small selves, thinking only of the comfortable conditions for this small self, 
while we destroy our large self. We should be able to be our true self. That 
means we should be able to he the river, we should be able to be the forest, 


the sun, and the ozone layer. We must do this to understand and to have 
hope for the future. 


The Art of Mindful Living 

Nature is our mother. Because we live cut off from her, we get sick. Some 
of us live in boxes called apartments, very high above the ground. Around us 
are only cement, metal, and hard things like that. Our fingers do not have a 
chance to touch the soil; we don’t grow lettuce anymore. Because we are so 
distant from our Mother Earth, we become sick. That is why we need to go 
out from time to time and be in nature. It is very important. We and our 
children should be in touch again with Mother Earth. In many cities, we 
cannot see trees — the color green is entirely absent from our view. 

One day, I imagined a city where there was only one tree left. The tree 
was still beautiful, but very much alone, surrounded by buildings, in the 
center of the city. Many people were getting sick, and most doctors did not 
know how to deal with the illness. But one very good doctor knew the 
causes of the sickness and gave this prescription to each patient: “Every day, 
take the bus and go to the center of the city to look at the tree. As you ap- 
proach it, practice breathing in and out, and when you get there, hug the tree, 
breathing in and out for fifteen minutes, while you look at the tree, so green, 
and smell its bark, so fragrant. If you do that, in a few weeks you will feel 
much better.” 

The people began to feel better, but very soon there were so many people 
rushing to the tree that they stood in line for miles and miles. You know that 
people of our time do not have much patience, so standing three or four 
hours to wait to hug the tree was too much, and they rebelled. They 
organized demonstrations in order to make a new law that each person could 
only hug the tree for five minutes, but of course that reduced the time for 
healing. And soon, the time was reduced to one minute, and the chance of 
being healed by our mother was lost. 

We could be in that situation very soon if we are not mindful. We have to 
practice awareness of each thing we do if we want to save our Mother Earth, 
and ourselves and our children as well. For example, when we look into our 
garbage, we can see lettuce, cucumbers, tomatoes, and flowers. When we 
throw a banana peel into the garbage, we are aware that it is a banana peel 
that we are throwing out and that it will be transformed into a flower or a 
vegetable very soon. That is exactly the practice of meditation. 


When we throw a plastic bag into the garbage, we know that it is different 
from a banana peel. It will take a long time to become a flower. “Throwing a 
plastic bag into the garbage, I know that I am throwing a plastic bag into the 
garbage.” That awareness alone helps us protect the Earth, make peace, and 
take care of life in the present moment and in the future. If we are aware, 
naturally we will try to use fewer plastic bags. This is an act of peace, a 
basic kind of peace action. 

When we throw a plastic disposable diaper into the garbage, we know that 
it takes even longer for it .to become a flower, four hundred years or longer. 
Knowing that using these kinds of diapers is not in the direction of peace, we 
look for other ways to take care of our baby. Practicing breathing and 
contemplating our body, feelings, mind, and objects of mind, we practice 
peace in the present moment. This is living mindfully. 

Nuclear waste is the worst kind of garbage. It takes about 250,000 years 
to become flowers. Forty of the fifty United States are already polluted by 
nuclear waste. We are making the Earth an impossible place to live for 
ourselves and for many generations of children. If we live our present 
moment mindfully, we will know what to do and what not to do, and we will 
try to do things in the direction of peace. 


Nourishing Awareness 

When we sit down to dinner and look at our plate filled with fragrant and 
appetizing food, we can nourish our awareness of the bitter pain of people 
who suffer from hunger. Every day, 40,000 children die as a result of hunger 
and malnutrition. Every day! Such a figure shocks us every time we hear it. 
Looking deeply at our plate, we can “see” Mother Earth, the farm workers, 
and the tragedy of hunger and malnutrition. 

We who live in North America and Europe are accustomed to eating 
grains and other foods imported from the Third World, such as coffee from 
Colombia, chocolate from Ghana, or fragrant rice from Thailand. We must 
be aware that children in these countries, except those from rich families, 
never see such fine products. They eat inferior foods, while the finer 
products are put aside for export in order to bring in foreign exchange. There 
are even some parents who, because they do not have the means to feed their 
children, resort to selling their children to be servants to families who have 
enough to eat. 

Before each meal, we can join our palms in mindfulness and think about 
the children who do not have enough to eat. Doing so will help us maintain 


mindfulness of our good fortune, and perhaps one day we will find ways to 
do something to help change the system of injustice that exists in the world. 
In many refugee families, before each meal, a child holds up his bowl of rice 
and says something like this: “Today, on the table, there are many delicious 
foods. I am grateful to be here with my family enjoying these wonderful 
dishes. I know there are many children less fortunate, who are very hungry.” 
Being a refugee he knows, for example, that most Thai children never see 
the kind of fine rice grown in Thailand that he is about to eat. It is difficult to 
explain to children in the “overdeveloped” nations that not all children in the 
world have such beautiful and nourishing food. Awareness of this fact alone 
can help us overcome many of our own psychological pains. Eventually our 
contemplations can help us see how to assist those who need our help so 
much. 

A Love Letter to Your Congressman 

In the peace movement there is a lot of anger, frustration, and 
misunderstanding. People in the peace movement can write very good 
protest letters, but they are not so skilled at writing love letters. We need to 
learn to write letters to the Congress and the President that they will want to 
read, and not just throw away. The way we speak, the kind of understanding, 
the kind of language we use should not turn people off. The President is a 
person like any of us. 

Can the peace movement talk in loving speech, showing the way for 
peace? I think that will depend on whether the people in the peace 
movement can “be peace.” Because without being peace, we cannot do 
anything for peace. If we cannot smile, we cannot help other people smile. If 
we are not peaceful, then we cannot contribute to the peace movement. 

I hope we can offer a new dimension to the peace movement. The peace 
movement often is filled with anger and hatred and does not fulfill the role 
we expect of it. A fresh way of being peace, of making peace is needed. That 
is why it is so important for us to practice mindfulness, to acquire the 
capacity to look, to see, and to understand. It would be wonderful if we 
could bring to the peace movement our non-dualistic way of looking at 
things. That alone would diminish hatred and aggression. Peace work means, 
first of all, being peace. We rely on each other. Our children are relying on 
us in order for them to have a future. 


Citizenship 


As citizens, we have a large responsibility. Our daily lives, the way we 
drink, what we eat, have to do with the world’ s political situation. Every day 
we do things, we are things that have to do with peace. If we are aware of 
our lifestyle, our way of consuming, of looking at things, we will know how 
to make peace right in the moment we are alive. We think that our 
government is free to make any policy it wishes, hut that freedom depends 
on our daily life. If we make it possible for them to change policies, they 
will do it. Now it is not yet possible. 

You may think that if you were to enter government and obtain power, 
you would be able to do anything you wanted, but that is not true. If you 
became President, you would be confronted by this hard fact — you would 
probably do almost exactly the same thing as our current President, perhaps 
a little better, perhaps a little worse. 

Meditation is to look deeply into things and to see how we can change 
ourselves and how we can transform our situation. To transform our 
situation is also to transform our minds. To transform our minds is also to 
transform our situation, because the situation is mind, and mind is situation. 
Awakening is important. The nature of the bombs, the nature of injustice, 
and the nature of our own beings are the same. 

As we ourselves begin to live more responsibly, we must ask our political 
leaders to move in the same direction. We have to encourage them to stop 
polluting our environment and our consciousness. We should help them 
appoint advisors who share our way of thinking about peace, so that they can 
turn to these people for advice and support. It will require some degree of 
enlightenment on our part to support our political leaders, especially when 
they are campaigning for office. We have the opportunity to tell them about 
many important things, instead of choosing leaders by how handsome they 
look on television and then feeling discouraged later by their lack of 
mindfulness. 

If we write articles and give speeches that express our conviction that 
political leaders should be helped by those who practice mindfulness, those 
who have a deep sense of calm and peace and a clear vision of what the 
world should be, we will begin to elect leaders who can help us move in the 
direction of peace. The French government has made some efforts in this 
direction, appointing as Ministers a number of ecologists and humanitarians, 
such as Bernard Cushman, who helped rescue boat people on the Gulf of 
Siam. This kind of attitude is a good sign. 



Ecology of Mind 

We need harmony, we need peace. Peace is based on respect for life, the 
spirit of reverence for life. Not only do we have to respect the lives of 
human beings, but we have to respect the lives of animals, vegetables, and 
minerals. Rocks can be alive. A rock can be destroyed. The Earth also. The 
destruction of our health by pollution of the air and water is linked to the 
destruction of the minerals. The way we farm, the way we deal with our 
garbage, all these things are related to each other. 

Ecology should be a deep ecology. Not only deep but universal, because 
there is pollution in our consciousness. Television, for instance, is a form of 
pollution for us and for our children. Television sows seeds of violence and 
anxiety in our children, and pollutes their consciousness, just as we destroy 
our environment by chemicals, tree-cutting, and polluting the water. We 
need to protect the ecology of the mind, or this kind of violence and 
recklessness will continue to spill over into many other areas of life. 


The Roots of War 

In 1966, when I was in the U.S. calling for a ceasefire to the war in 
Vietnam, a young American peace activist stood up during a talk I was 
giving and shouted, “The best thing you can do is go back to your country 
and defeat the American aggressors! You shouldn’t he here. There is 
absolutely no use to your being here!” He and many Americans wanted 
peace, but the kind of peace they wanted was the defeat of one side in order 
to satisfy their anger. Because they had called for a ceasefire and had not 
succeeded, they became angry, and finally they were unable to accept any 
solution short of the defeat of their own country. But we Vietnamese who 
were suffering under the bombs had to be more realistic. We wanted peace. 
We did not care about anyone’s victory or defeat. We just wanted the bombs 
to stop falling on us. But many people in the peace movement opposed our 
proposal for an immediate ceasefire. No one seemed to understand. 

So when I heard that Youngman shouting, “Go home and defeat the 
American aggressors,” I took several deep breaths to regain myself, and I 
said, “Sir, it seems to me that many of the roots of the war are here in your 
country. That is why I have come. One of the roots is your way of seeing the 
world. Both sides are victims of a wrong policy, a policy that believes in the 
force of violence to settle problems. I do not want Vietnamese to die, and I 
do not want American soldiers to die either.” 


The roots of war are in the way we live our daily lives — the way we 
develop our industries, build up our society, and consume goods. We have to 
look deeply into the situation, and we will see the roots of war. We cannot 
just blame one side or the other. We have to transcend the tendency to take 
sides. 

During any conflict, we need people who can understand the suffering of 
all sides. For example, if a number of people in South Africa could go to 
each side and understand their suffering, and communicate that to the other 
sides that would be very helpful. We need links. We need communication. 

Practicing nonviolence is first of all to become nonviolence. Then when a 
difficult situation presents itself, we will react in a way that will help the 
situation. This applies to problems of the family as well as to problems of 
society. 


Like a Leaf, We Have Many Stems 

One autumn day, I was in a park, absorbed in the contemplation of a very 
small, beautiful leaf, shaped like a heart. Its color was almost red, and it was 
barely hanging on the branch, nearly ready to fall down. I spent a long time 
with it, and I asked the leaf a number of questions. I found out the leaf had 
been a mother to the tree. Usually we think that the tree is the mother and the 
leaves are just children, hut as I looked at the leaf I saw that the leaf is also a 
mother to the tree. The sap that the roots take up is only water and minerals, 
not sufficient to nourish the tree. So the tree distributes that sap to the leaves, 
and the leaves transform the rough sap into elaborated sap and, with the help 
of the sun and gas, send it back to the tree for nourishment. Therefore, the 
leaves are also the mother to the tree. Since the leaf is linked to the tree by a 
stem, the communication between them is easy to see. We do not have a 
stem linking us to our mother anymore, but when we were in her womb, we 
had a very long stem, an umbilical cord. The oxygen and the nourishment 
we needed came to us through that stem. But on the day we were bom, it 
was cut off, and we received the illusion that we became independent. That 
is not true. We continue to rely on our mother for a very long time, and we 
have many other mothers as well. The Earth is our mother. We have a great 
many stems linking us to our Mother Earth. There are stems linking us with 
the clouds. If there are no clouds, there will be no water for us to drink. We 
are made of at least seventy percent water, and the stem between the cloud 
and us is really there. This is also the case with the river, the forest, the 
logger, and the farmer. There are hundreds of thousands of stems linking us 


to everything in the cosmos, supporting us and making it possible for us to 
be. Do you see the link between you and me? If you are not there, I am not 
here. This is certain. If you do not see it yet, please look more deeply and I 
am sure you will. 

I asked the leaf whether it was frightened because it was autumn and the 
other leaves were falling. The leaf told me, “No. During the whole spring 
and summer I was completely alive. I worked hard to help nourish the tree, 
and now much of me is in the tree. I am not limited by this form. I am also 
the whole tree, and when I go back to the soil, I will continue to nourish the 
tree. So I don’t worry at all. As I leave this branch and float to the ground, I 
will wave to the tree and tell her, ‘I will see you again very soon.’” 

That day there was a wind blowing and, after a while, I saw the leaf leave 
the branch and float down to the soil, dancing joyfully, because as it floated 
it saw itself already there in the tree. It was so happy. I bowed my head, 
knowing that I have a lot to learn from that leaf. 


We Are All Linked to Each Other 

Millions of people follow sports. If you love to watch soccer or baseball, 
you probably root for one team and identify with them. You may watch the 
games with despair and elation. Perhaps you give a little kick or swing to 
help die ball along. If you do not take sides, the fun is missing. In wars we 
also pick sides, usually the side that is being threatened. Peace movements 
are born of this feeling. We get angry, we shout, but rarely do we rise above 
ail this to look at a conflict die way a mother would who is watching her two 
children fighting. She seeks only their reconciliation. 

“In order to fight each other, the chicks born from the same mother hen 
put colors on their faces.” This is a well-known Vietnamese saying. Putting 
colors on our own face is to make ourselves a stranger to our own brothers 
and sisters. We can only shoot others when they are strangers. Real efforts 
for reconciliation arise when we see with the eyes of compassion, and that 
ability comes when we see clearly the nature of interbeing and 
interpenetration of all beings. 

In our lives, we may be lucky enough to know someone whose love 
extends to animals and plants. We may also know people who although they 
themselves live in a safe situation, realize that famine, disease, and 
oppression are destroying millions of people on Earth and look for ways to 
help those who suffer. They cannot forget the downtrodden, even amidst the 
pressures of their own lives. At least to some extent, these people have real- 


ized the interdependent nature of life. They know that the survival of the 
underdeveloped countries cannot be separated from the survival of the 
materially wealthy, technically advanced countries. Poverty and oppression 
bring war. In our times, every war involves all countries. The fate if each 
country is linked to the fate of all others. 

When will the chicks of the same mother hen remove the colors from their 
faces and recognize each other as brothers and sisters? The only way to end 
the danger is for each of us to do so, and to say to others, “I am your 
brother.” “I am your sister.” “We are all humankind, and our life is one.” 


Reconciliation 

What can we do when we have hurt people and now they consider us to 
be their enemy? These people might he people in our family, in our 
community, or in another country. I think you know the answer. There are 
few things to do. The first thing is to take the time to say, “I am sorry; I hurt 
you out of my ignorance, out of my lack of mindfulness, out of my lack of 
skillfulness. I will try my best to change myself. I don’t dare to say anything 
more to you,” Sometimes, we do not have the intention to hurt, hut because 
we are not mindful or skillful enough, we hurt someone. Being mindful in 
our daily life is important, speaking in a way that will not hurt anyone. 

The second thing to do is to try to bring out the best part in ourselves, the 
part of the flower, to transform ourselves. That is the only way to 
demonstrate what you have just said. When you have become fresh and 
pleasant, the other person will notice very soon. Then when there is a chance 
to approach that person, you can come to her as a flower and she will notice 
immediately that you are quite different. You may not have to say anything. 
Just seeing you like that, she will accept you and forgive you. That is called 
“speaking with your life and not just with words.” 

When you begin to see that your enemy is suffering, that is the beginning 
of insight. When you see in yourself the wish that the other person stop 
suffering that is a sign of real love. But be careful. Sometimes you may think 
that you are stronger than you actually are. To test your real strength, try 
going to the other person to listen and talk to him or her, and you will 
discover right away whether your loving compassion is real. You need the 
other person in order to test. If you just meditate on some abstract principle 
such as understanding or love, it may be just your imagination and not real 
understanding or real love. 


Reconciliation does not mean to sign an agreement with duplicity and 
cruelty. Reconciliation opposes all forms of ambition, without taking sides. 
Most of us want to take sides in each encounter or conflict. We distinguish 
right from wrong based on partial evidence or hearsay. We need indignation 
in order to act, but even righteous, legitimate indignation is not enough. Our 
world does not lack people willing to throw themselves into action. What we 
need are people who are capable of loving, of not taking sides so that they 
can embrace the whole of reality. 

We have to continue to practice mindfulness and reconciliation until we 
can see a child’s body of skin and bones in Uganda or Ethiopia as our own, 
until the hunger and pain in the bodies of all species are our own. Then we 
will have realized non-discrimination, real love. Then we can look at all 
beings with the eyes of compassion, and we can do the real work to help 
alleviate suffering. 


Call Me by My True Names 

In Plum Village, where 1 live in France, we receive many letters from the 
refugee camps in Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, and the 
Philippines, hundreds each week. It is very painful to read them, but we have 
to do it, we have to he in contact. We try our best to help, but the suffering is 
enormous, and sometimes we are discouraged. It is said that half the boat 
people die in the ocean. Only half arrive at the shores in Southeast Asia, and 
even then they may not be safe. 

There are many young girls, boat people, who are raped by sea pirates. 
Even though the United Nations and many countries try to help the 
government of Thailand prevent that kind of piracy, sea pirates continue to 
inflict much suffering on the refugees. One day we received a letter telling 
us about a young girl on a small boat who was raped by a Thai pirate. She 
was only twelve, and she jumped into the ocean and drowned herself. 

When you first learn of something like that, you get angry at the pirate. 
You naturally take the side of the girl. As you look more deeply you will see 
it differently. If you take the side of the little girl, then it is easy. You only 
have to take a gun and shoot the pirate. But we cannot do that. In my 
meditation I saw that if I had been born in the village of the pirate and raised 
in the same conditions as he was, there is a great likelihood that I would be- 
come a pirate. I saw that many babies are bom along the Gulf of Siam, 
hundreds every day, and if we educators, social workers, politicians, and 
others do not do something about the situation, in twenty-five years a 


number of them will become sea pirates. That is certain. If you or I were 
bom today in those fishing villages, we may become sea pirates in twenty- 
five years. If you take a gun and shoot the pirate, you shoot all of us, because 
all of us are to some extent responsible for this state of affairs. 

After a long meditation, I wrote this poem. In it, there are three people: 
the twelve-year-old girl, the pirate, and me. Can we look at each other and 
recognize ourselves in each other? The title of the poem is “Please Call Me 
by My True Names,” because I have so many names. When I hear one of 
these names, I have to say, “Yes.” 


Do not say that I’ll depart tomorrow 
because even today I still arrive. 


Look deeply: I arrive in every second 

to be a bud on a spring branch, 

to be a tiny bird, with wings still fragile, 

learning to sing in my new nest, 

to be a caterpillar in the heart of a flower, 

to be a jewel hiding itself in a stone. 


I still arrive, in order to laugh and to cry, 
in order to fear and to hope. 

The rhythm of my heart is the birth and 
death of all that are alive. 


lam the mayfly metamorphosing on the surface of the river, 
and I am the bird which, when spring comes, arrives in time 
to eat the mayfly. 


Iam the frog swimming happily in the clear pond, 

and I am also the grass-snake who, approaching in silence, 

feeds itself on the frog. 



I am the child in Uganda, all skin and bones, 
my legs as thin as bamboo sticks, 

and I am the arms merchant, selling deadly weapons to Uganda. 

I am the twelve-year-old girl, refugee on a small boat, 
who throws herself into the ocean after being raped by a sea pirate, 
and I am the pirate, my heart not yet capable of seeing and loving, 
lam a member of the politburo, with plenty of power in my 
hands, and I am the man who has to pay his “debt of blood” to my 
people, dying slowly in a forced labor camp. 

My joy is like spring, so warm it makes flowers bloom in all walks of life. 
My pain is like a river of tears, so full it fills the four oceans. 

Please call me by my true names, 

so I can hear all my cries and laughs at once, 

so lean see that my joy and pain are one. 

Please call me by my true names, 
so lean wake up, 

and so the door of my heart can be left open, 
the door of compassion. 


Suffering Nourishes Compassion 

We have been practicing “engaged Buddhism” in Vietnam for the last 
thirty years. During the war, we could not just sit in the meditation hall. We 
had to practice mindfulness everywhere, especially where the worst 
suffering was going on. 

Being in touch with the kind of suffering we encountered during the war 
can heal us of some of the suffering we experience when our lives are not 
very meaningful or useful. When you confront the kinds of difficulties we 
faced during the war, you see that you can be a source of compassion and a 
great help to many suffering people. In that intense suffering, you feel a kind 
of relief and joy within yourself, because you know that you are an 
instrument of compassion. Understanding such incense suffering and 


realizing compassion in the midst of it, you become a joyful person, even if 
your life is very hard. 

Last winter, some friends and I went to visit the refugee camps in Hong 
Kong, and we witnessed a lot of suffering. There were “boat people” who 
were just one or two years old, who were about to be sent back to their 
country because they were classified as illegal immigrants. They had lost 
both father and mother during the trip. When you see that kind of suffering, 
you know that the suffering your friends in Europe and America are 
undergoing is not very great. 

Every time we come back from such a contact, we see that the city of 
Paris is not very real. The way people live there and the reality of the 
suffering in other parts of the world are so different. I asked the question, 
how could people live like this when things are like that? But if you stay in 
Paris for ten years without being in touch, you find it normal. 

Meditation is a point of contact. Sometimes you do not have to go to the 
place of suffering. You just sit quietly on your cushion, and you can see 
everything. You can actualize everything, and you can be aware of what is 
going on in the world. Out of that kind of awareness, compassion and 
understanding arise naturally, and you can stay right in your own country 
and perform social action. 


Love in Action 

During our journey together, I have presented a number of practices to 
help us maintain mindfulness of what is going on inside us and immediately 
around us. Now, as we make our way through the wider world, some 
additional guidelines can help us and protect us. Several members of our 
community have been practicing the following principles, and I think you 
may also find them useful in making choices as to how to live in our 
contemporary world. We call them the fourteen precepts of the Order of 
Interbeing. 

1. Do not be idolatrous about or bound to any doctrine, theory, or 
ideology. All systems of thought are guiding means; they are not absolute 
truth. 

2. Do not think that the knowledge you presently possess is changeless, 
absolute truth. Avoid being narrow-minded and bound to present views. 
Learn and practice non-attachment from views in order to be open to receive 
others’ viewpoints. Truth is found in life and not merely in conceptual 


knowledge. Be ready to learn throughout your entire life and to observe real- 
ity in yourself and in the world at all times. 

3. Do not force others, including children, by any means whatsoever, to 
adopt your views, whether by authority, threat, money, propaganda, or even 
education. However, through compassionate dialogue, help others renounce 
fanaticism and narrowness. 

4. Do not avoid contact with suffering or close your eyes before suffering. 
Do not lose awareness of the existence of suffering in the life of the world. 
Find ways to be with those who are suffering, by all means, including 
personal contact and visits, images, and sound. By such means, awaken 
yourself and others to the reality of suffering in the world. 

5. Do not accumulate wealth while millions are hungry. Do not take as the 
aim of your life fame, profit, wealth, or sensual pleasure. Live simply and 
share time, energy, and material resources with those who are in need. 

6. Do not maintain anger or hatred. Learn to penetrate and transform them 
while they are still seeds in your consciousness. As soon as anger or hatred 
arises, turn your attention to your breathing in order to see and understand 
the nature of your anger or hatred and the nature of the persons who have 
caused your anger or hatred. 

7. Do not lose yourself in dispersion and in your surroundings. Practice 
mindful breathing in order to come back to what is happening in the present 
moment. Be in touch with what is wondrous, refreshing, and healing, both 
inside and around yourself. Plant the seeds of joy, peace, and understanding 
in yourself in order to facilitate the work of transformation in the depths of 
your consciousness. 

8. Do not utter words that can create discord and cause the community to 
break. Make every effort to reconcile and resolve all conflicts, however 
small. 

9. Do not say untruthful things for the sake of personal interest or to 
impress people. Do not utter words that cause division and hatred. Do not 
spread news that you do not know to be certain. Do not criticize or condemn 
things that you are not sure of. Always speak truthfully and constructively. 
Have the courage to speak out about situations of injustice, even when doing 
so may threaten your own safety. 

10. Do not use the religious community for personal gain or profit, or 
transform your community into a political party. A religious community 
should, however, take a clear stand against oppression and injustice, and 
should strive to change the situation without engaging in partisan conflicts. 



1 1 . Do not live with a vocation that is harmful to humans and nature. Do 
not invest in companies that deprive others of their chance to live. Select a 
vocation that helps realize your ideal of compassion. 

12. Do not kill. Do not let others kill. Find whatever means possible to 
protect life and prevent war. 

13. Possess nothing that should belong to others. Respect the property of 
others but prevent others from enriching themselves from human suffering 
or the suffering of other beings. 

14. Do not mistreat your body. Learn to handle it with respect. Do not 
look on your body as only an instrument. Preserve vital energies for the 
realization of the Way. Sexual expression should not happen without love 
and commitment. In sexual relationships, be aware of future suffering that 
may be caused. To preserve the happiness of others, respect the rights and 
commitments of others. Be fully aware of the responsibility of bringing new 
lives into the world. Meditate on die world into which you are bringing new 
beings. 


The River 

Once upon a time there was a beautiful river finding her way among the 
hills, forests and meadows. She began by being a joyful stream of water, a 
spring always dancing and singing as she ran down from the top of the 
mountain. She was very young at the time, and as she came to die lowland 
she slowed down. She was thinking about going to the ocean. As she grew 
up, she learned to look beautiful, winding gracefully among the hills and 
meadows. 

One day she noticed the clouds within herself. Clouds of all sorts of colors 
and forms. She did nothing during these days but chase after clouds. She 
wanted to possess a cloud, to have one for herself. But clouds float and 
travel in the sky, and they are always changing their form. Sometimes they 
look like an overcoat, sometimes like a horse. Because of the nature of 
impermanence within the clouds, die river suffered very much. Her pleasure, 
her joy had become just chasing after clouds, one after another, but despair, 
anger, and hatred became her life. 

Then one day a strong wind came and blew away all the clouds in the sky. 
The sky became completely empty. Our river thought that life was not worth 
living, for there were no longer any clouds to chase after. She wanted to die. 
“If there are no clouds, why should I be alive?” But how can a river take her 
own life? 


That night the river had the opportunity to go back to herself for the first 
time. She had been running for so long after something outside of herself 
that she had never seen herself. That night was the first opportunity for her 
to hear her own crying, the sounds of water crashing against the banks of the 
river. Because she was able to listen to her own voice, she discovered 
something quite important. 

She realized that what she had been looking for was already in herself. 
She found out that clouds are nothing but water. Clouds are bom from water 
and will return to water. And she found out that she herself is also water. 

The next morning when the sun was in the sky, she discovered something 
beautiful. She saw the blue sky for the first time. She had never noticed it 
before. She had only been interested in clouds, and she had missed seeing 
the sky, which is the home of all the clouds. Clouds are impermanent, but 
the sky is stable. She realized that the immense sky had been within her 
heart since the very beginning. This great insight brought her peace and 
happiness. As she saw the vast wonderful blue sky, she knew that her peace 
and stability would never be lost again. 

That afternoon the clouds returned, but this time she did not want to 
possess any of them. She could see the beauty of each cloud, and she was 
able to welcome all of them. When a cloud came by, she would greet him or 
her with loving kindness. When that cloud wanted to go away, she would 
wave to him or her happily and with loving kindness. She realized that all 
clouds are her. She didn’t have to choose between the clouds and herself. 
Peace and harmony existed between her and the clouds. 

That evening something wonderful happened. When she opened her heart 
completely to the evening sky she received the image of the full moon — 
beautiful, round, like a jewel within herself. She had never imagined that she 
could receive such a beautiful image. There is a very beautiful poem in 
Chinese: “The fresh and beautiful moon is traveling in the utmost empty sky. 
When the mind-rivers of living beings are free, that image of the beautiful 
moon will reflect in each of us.” 

This was the mind of me river at that moment. She received the image of 
that beautiful moon within her heart, and water, clouds, and moon took each 
other’ s hands and practiced walking meditation slowly, slowly to the ocean. 

There is nothing to chase after. We can go back to ourselves, enjoy our 
breathing, our smiling, ourselves, and our beautiful environment. 


Entering the Twenty-First Century 


The word “policy” is very much in use these days. There seems to be a 
policy for just about everything. I have heard that the so-called developed 
nations are contemplating a garbage policy to send their trash on huge 
barges to the Third World. 

I think that we need a “policy” for dealing with our suffering. We do not 
want to condone it, but we need to find a way to make use of our suffering, 
for our good and for the good of others. There has been so much suffering in 
the twentieth century: two world wars, concentration camps in Europe, the 
killing fields of Cambodia, refugees from Vietnam, Central America, and 
elsewhere fleeing their countries with no place to land. We need to articulate 
a policy for these kinds of garbage also. We need to use the suffering of the 
twentieth century as compost, so that together we can create flowers for the 
twenty-first century. 

When we see photographs and programs about the atrocities of the Nazis, 
the gas chambers and the camps, we feel afraid. We may say, “I didn’t do it; 
they did it.” But if we had been there, we may have done the same thing, or 
we may have been too cowardly to stop it, as was the case for so many. We 
have to put all these things into our compost pile to fertilize the ground. In 
Germany today, the young people have a kind of complex that they are 
somehow responsible for the suffering. It is important that these young 
people and the generation responsible for the war begin anew, and together 
create a path of mindfulness so that our children in the next century can 
avoid repeating the same mistakes. The flower of tolerance to see and 
appreciate cultural diversity is one flower we can cultivate for the children 
of the twenty-first century. Another flower is the truth of suffering — there 
has been so much unnecessary suffering in our century. If we are willing to 
work together and learn together, we can all benefit from the mistakes of our 
time, and, seeing with the eyes of compassion and understanding, we can 
offer die next century a beautiful garden and a clear path. 

Take the hand of your child and invite her to go out and sit with you on 
the grass. The two of you may want to contemplate the green grass, the Hide 
flowers that grow among the grasses, and the sky. Breathing and smiling 
together — that is peace education. If we know how to appreciate these 
beautiful things, we will not have to search for anything else. Peace is 
available in every moment, in every breath, in every step. 

I have enjoyed our journey together. I hope you have enjoyed it too. We 
shall see each other again.
